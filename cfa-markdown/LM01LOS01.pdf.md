- Net return, which is equal to the gross return less managerial and administrative expenses, is a better return measure of what an investor actually earned.
- The after-tax nominal return is computed as the total return minus any allowance for taxes on dividends, interest, and realized gains.
- Real returns are particularly useful in comparing returns across time periods because inflation rates may vary over time and are particularly useful for comparing investments across time periods and performance between different asset classes with different taxation.
- Leveraging a portfolio, via borrowing or futures, can amplify the portfolio's gains or losses.


## INTEREST RATES AND TIME VALUE OF MONEY

interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs and explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing distinct types of risk

The time value of money establishes the equivalence between cash flows occurring on different dates. As cash received today is preferred to cash promised in the future, we must establish a consistent basis for this trade-off to compare financial instruments in cases in which cash is paid or received at different times. An interest rate (or yield), denoted $r$, is a rate of return that reflects the relationship between differently dated - timed - cash flows. If USD 9,500 today and USD 10,000 in one year are equivalent in value, then USD 10,000 - USD 9,500 = USD 500 is the required compensation for receiving USD 10,000 in one year rather than now. The interest rate (i.e., the required compensation stated as a rate of return) is USD 500/USD 9,500 $=0.0526$ or 5.26 percent.

Interest rates can be thought of in three ways:

- First, they can be considered required rates of return-that is, the minimum rate of return an investor must receive to accept an investment.
- Second, interest rates can be considered discount rates. In the previous example, 5.26 percent is the discount rate at which USD 10,000 in one year is equivalent to USD 9,500 today. Thus, we use the terms "interest rate" and "discount rate" almost interchangeably.
- Third, interest rates can be considered opportunity costs. An opportunity cost is the value that investors forgo by choosing a course of action. In the example, if the party who supplied USD 9,500 had instead decided to spend it today, he would have forgone earning 5.26 percent by consuming rather than saving. So, we can view 5.26 percent as the opportunity cost of current consumption.


## Determinants of Interest Rates

Economics tells us that interest rates are set by the forces of supply and demand, where investors supply funds and borrowers demand their use. Taking the perspective of investors in analyzing market-determined interest rates, we can view an interest rate $r$ as being composed of a real risk-free interest rate plus a set of premiums that are required returns or compensation for bearing distinct types of risk:
$r=$ Real risk-free interest rate + Inflation premium + Default risk premium + Liquidity premium + Maturity premium. (1)

- The real risk-free interest rate is the single-period interest rate for a completely risk-free security if no inflation were expected. In economic theory, the real risk-free rate reflects the time preferences of individuals for current versus future real consumption.
- The inflation premium compensates investors for expected inflation and reflects the average inflation rate expected over the maturity of the debt. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of a unit of currency-the amount of goods and services one can buy with it.
- The default risk premium compensates investors for the possibility that the borrower will fail to make a promised payment at the contracted time and in the contracted amount.
- The liquidity premium compensates investors for the risk of loss relative to an investment's fair value if the investment needs to be converted to cash quickly. US Treasury bills (T-bills), for example, do not bear a liquidity premium because large amounts of them can be bought and sold without affecting their market price. Many bonds of small issuers, by contrast, trade infrequently after they are issued; the interest rate on such bonds includes a liquidity premium reflecting the relatively high costs (including the impact on price) of selling a position.
- The maturity premium compensates investors for the increased sensitivity of the market value of debt to a change in market interest rates as maturity is extended, in general (holding all else equal). The difference between the interest rate on longer-maturity, liquid Treasury debt and that on short-term Treasury debt typically reflects a positive maturity premium for the longer-term debt (and possibly different inflation premiums as well).

The sum of the real risk-free interest rate and the inflation premium is the nominal risk-free interest rate:

The nominal risk-free interest rate reflects the combination of a real risk-free rate plus an inflation premium:
$(1+$ nominal risk-free rate $)=(1+$ real risk-free rate $)(1+$ inflation premium $)$.
In practice, however, the nominal rate is often approximated as the sum of the real risk-free rate plus an inflation premium:

Nominal risk-free rate $=$ Real risk-free rate + inflation premium .
Many countries have short-term government debt whose interest rate can be considered to represent the nominal risk-free interest rate over that time horizon in that country. The French government issues BTFs, or negotiable fixed-rate discount Treasury bills (Bons du Trésor à taux fixe et à intérêts précomptés), with maturities of up to one year. The Japanese government issues a short-term Treasury bill with maturities of 6 and 12 months. The interest rate on a 90-day US T-bill, for example, represents the nominal risk-free interest rate for the United States over the next three
months. Typically, interest rates are quoted in annual terms, so the interest rate on a 90-day government debt security quoted at 3 percent is the annualized rate and not the actual interest rate earned over the 90-day period.

Whether the interest rate we use is a required rate of return, or a discount rate, or an opportunity cost, the rate encompasses the real risk-free rate and a set of risk premia that depend on the characteristics of the cash flows. The foundational set of premia consist of inflation, default risk, liquidity risk, and maturity risk. All these premia vary over time and continuously change, as does the real risk-free rate. Consequently, all interest rates fluctuate, but how much they change depends on various economic fundamentals-and on the expectation of how these various economic fundamentals can change in the future.

## EXAMPLE 1

## Determining Interest Rates

Exhibit 1 presents selected information for five debt securities. All five investments promise only a single payment at maturity. Assume that premiums relating to inflation, liquidity, and default risk are constant across all time horizons.

Exhibit 1: Investments Alternatives and Their Characteristics

| Investment | Maturity (in years) | Liquidity | Default Risk | Interest Rate (\%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 2 | High | Low | 2.0 |
| 2 | 2 | Low | Low | 2.5 |
| 3 | 7 | Low | Low | $\mathrm{r}_{3}$ |
| 4 | 8 | High | Low | 4.0 |
| 5 | 8 | Low | High | 6.5 |

Based on the information in Exhibit 1, address the following:

1. Explain the difference between the interest rates offered by Investment 1 and Investment 2.

## Solution:

Investment 2 is identical to Investment 1 except that Investment 2 has low liquidity. The difference between the interest rate on Investment 2 and Investment 1 is 0.5 percent. This difference in the two interest rates represents a liquidity premium, which represents compensation for the lower liquidity of Investment 2 (the risk of loss relative to an investment's fair value if the investment needs to be converted to cash quickly).
2. Estimate the default risk premium affecting all securities.

## Solution:

To estimate the default risk premium, identify two investments that have the same maturity but different levels of default risk. Investments 4 and 5 both have a maturity of eight years but different levels of default risk. Investment 5, however, has low liquidity and thus bears a liquidity premium relative to Investment 4 . From Part A, we know the liquidity premium is 0.5 percent. The difference between the interest rates offered by Investments 5 and 4 is 2.5 percent $(6.5 \%-4.0 \%)$, of which 0.5 percent is a liquidity premium. This
implies that 2.0 percent $(2.5 \%-0.5 \%)$ must represent a default risk premium reflecting Investment 5's relatively higher default risk.
3. Calculate upper and lower limits for the unknown interest rate for Investment $3, r_{3}$.

## Solution:

Investment 3 has liquidity risk and default risk comparable to Investment 2, but with its longer time to maturity, Investment 3 should have a higher maturity premium and offer a higher interest rate than Investment 2 . Therefore, the interest rate on Investment $3, r_{3}$, should thus be above 2.5 percent (the interest rate on Investment 2).
If the liquidity of Investment 3 was high, Investment 3 would match Investment 4 except for Investment 3's shorter maturity. We would then conclude that Investment 3's interest rate should be less than the interest rate offered by Investment 4, which is 4 percent. In contrast to Investment 4, however, Investment 3 has low liquidity. It is possible that the interest rate on Investment 3 exceeds that of Investment 4 despite Investment 3's shorter maturity, depending on the relative size of the liquidity and maturity premiums. However, we would expect $r_{3}$ to be less than 4.5 percent, the expected interest rate on Investment 4 if it had low liquidity ( $4 \%+0.5 \%$, the liquidity premium). Thus, we should expect in the interest rate offered by Investment 3 to be between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent.

## RATES OF RETURN

calculate and interpret different approaches to return measurement over time and describe their appropriate uses

Financial assets are frequently defined in terms of their return and risk characteristics. Comparison along these two dimensions simplifies the process of building a portfolio from among all available assets. In this lesson, we will compute, evaluate, and compare various measures of return.

Financial assets normally generate two types of return for investors. First, they may provide periodic income through cash dividends or interest payments. Second, the price of a financial asset can increase or decrease, leading to a capital gain or loss.

Some financial assets provide return through only one of these mechanisms. For example, investors in non-dividend-paying stocks obtain their return from price movement only. Other assets only generate periodic income. For example, defined benefit pension plans and retirement annuities make income payments over the life of a beneficiary.

## Holding Period Return

Returns can be measured over a single period or over multiple periods. Single-period returns are straightforward because there is only one way to calculate them. Multiple-period returns, however, can be calculated in various ways and it is important to be aware of these differences to avoid confusion.
