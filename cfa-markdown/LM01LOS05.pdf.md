We can also express $P_{T} / P_{0}$ as the product of price relatives:

$$
P_{T} / P_{0}=\left(P_{T} / P_{T-1}\right)\left(P_{T-1} / P_{T-2}\right) \ldots\left(P_{1} / P_{0}\right)
$$

Taking logs of both sides of this equation, we find that the continuously compounded return to time $T$ is the sum of the one-period continuously compounded returns:

$$
r_{0, \mathrm{~T}}=r_{T-1, T}+r_{T-2, T-1}+\ldots+r_{0,1}
$$

Using holding period returns to find the ending value of a USD1 investment involves the multiplication of quantities ( $1+$ holding period return). Using continuously compounded returns involves addition (as shown in Equation 14), which is a desirable property of continuously compounded returns and which we will use throughout the curriculum.

## OTHER MAJOR RETURN MEASURES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS

The statistical measures of return discussed in the previous section are generally applicable across a wide range of assets and time periods. Special assets, however, such as mutual funds, and other considerations, such as taxes or inflation, may require more specific return measures.

Although it is not possible to consider all types of special measures, we will discuss the effect of fees (gross versus net returns), taxes (pre-tax and after-tax returns), inflation (nominal and real returns), and the effect of leverage. Many investors use mutual funds or other external entities (i.e., investment vehicles) for investment. In those cases, funds charge management fees and expenses to the investors. Consequently, gross and net-of-fund-expense returns should also be considered. Of course, an investor may be interested in the net-of-expenses after-tax real return, which is in fact what an investor truly receives. We consider these additional return measures in the following sections.

## Gross and Net Return

A gross return is the return earned by an asset manager prior to deductions for management expenses, custodial fees, taxes, or any other expenses that are not directly related to the generation of returns but rather related to the management and administration of an investment. These expenses are not deducted from the gross return because they may vary with the amount of assets under management or may vary because of the tax status of the investor. Trading expenses, however, such as commissions, are accounted for in (i.e., deducted from) the computation of gross return because trading expenses contribute directly to the return earned by the manager. Thus, gross return is an appropriate measure for evaluating and comparing the investment skill of asset managers because it does not include any fees related to the management and administration of an investment.

Net return is a measure of what the investment vehicle (e.g., mutual fund) has earned for the investor. Net return accounts for (i.e., deducts) all managerial and administrative expenses that reduce an investor's return. Because individual investors are most concerned about the net return (i.e., what they actually receive), small mutual funds with a limited amount of assets under management are at a disadvantage compared
with the larger funds that can spread their largely fixed administrative expenses over a larger asset base. As a result, many small mutual funds waive part of the expenses to keep the funds competitive.

## Pre-Tax and After-Tax Nominal Return

All return measures discussed up to this point are pre-tax nominal returns-that is, no adjustment has been made for taxes or inflation. In general, all returns are pre-tax nominal returns unless they are otherwise designated.

Many investors are concerned about the possible tax liability associated with their returns because taxes reduce the net return that they receive. Capital gains and income may be taxed differently, depending on the jurisdiction. Capital gains come in two forms: short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. Long-term capital gains receive preferential tax treatment in a number of countries. Interest income is taxed as ordinary income in most countries. Dividend income may be taxed as ordinary income, may have a lower tax rate, or may be exempt from taxes depending on the country and the type of investor. The after-tax nominal return is computed as the total return minus any allowance for taxes on dividends, interest, and realized gains. Bonds issued at a discount to the par value may be taxed based on accrued gains instead of realized gains.

Because taxes are paid on realized capital gains and income, the investment manager can minimize the tax liability by selecting appropriate securities (e.g., those subject to more favorable taxation, all other investment considerations equal) and reducing trading turnover. Therefore, taxable investors evaluate investment managers based on the after-tax nominal return.

## Real Returns

Previously this learning module approximated the relationship between the nominal rate and the real rate by the following relationship:

$$
(1+\text { nominal risk-free rate })=(1+\text { real risk-free rate })(1+\text { inflation premium }) .
$$

This relationship can be extended to link the relationship between nominal and real returns. Specifically, the nominal return consists of a real risk-free rate of return to compensate for postponed consumption; inflation as loss of purchasing power; and a risk premium for assuming risk. Frequently, the real risk-free return and the risk premium are combined to arrive at the real "risky" rate and is simply referred to as the real return, or:

$$
(1+\text { real return })=\frac{(1+\text { real risk } \text {-free rate })(1+\text { risk premium })}{1+\text { inflation premium }} .
$$

Real returns are particularly useful in comparing returns across time periods because inflation rates may vary over time. Real returns are also useful in comparing returns among countries when returns are expressed in local currencies instead of a constant investor currency and when inflation rates vary between countries (which are usually the case).

Finally, the after-tax real return is what the investor receives as compensation for postponing consumption and assuming risk after paying taxes on investment returns. As a result, the after-tax real return becomes a reliable benchmark for making investment decisions. Although it is a measure of an investor's benchmark return, it is not commonly calculated by asset managers because it is difficult to estimate a general tax component applicable to all investors. For example, the tax component depends
on an investor's specific taxation rate (marginal tax rate), how long the investor holds an investment (long-term versus short-term), and the type of account the asset is held in (tax-exempt, tax-deferred, or normal).

## EXAMPLE 14

## Computation of Special Returns

Let's return to Example 8. After reading this section, Mr. Lohrmann decided that he was not being fair to the fund manager by including the asset management fee and other expenses because the small size of the fund would put it at a competitive disadvantage. He learns that the fund spends a fixed amount of EUR500,000 every year on expenses that are unrelated to the manager's performance.

Mr. Lohrmann has become concerned that both taxes and inflation may reduce his return. Based on the current tax code, he expects to pay 20 percent tax on the return he earns from his investment. Historically, inflation has been around 2 percent and he expects the same rate of inflation to be maintained.

1. Estimate the annual gross return for the first year by adding back the fixed expenses.
Solution:
The gross return for the first year is higher by 1.67 percent (= EUR500,000/ EUR30,000,000) than the 15 percent\% investor return reported by the fund. Thus, the gross return for the first year is 16.67 percent ( $=15 \%+1.67 \%$ ).
2. What is the net return that investors in the Rhein Valley Superior Fund earned during the five-year period?

## Solution:

The investor return reported by the mutual fund is the net return of the fund after accounting for all direct and indirect expenses. The net return is also the pre-tax nominal return because it has not been adjusted for taxes or inflation. From Example. 8, the net return for the five-year holding period was calculated as 42.35 percent.
3. What is the after-tax net return for the first year that investors earned from the Rhein Valley Superior Fund? Assume that all gains are realized at the end of the year and the taxes are paid immediately at that time.

## Solution:

The net return earned by investors during the first year was 15 percent. Applying a 20 percent tax rate, the after-tax return that accrues to investors is 12 percent $[=15 \%-(0.20 \times 15 \%)]$.
4. What is the after-tax real return that investors would have earned in the fifth year?

## Solution:

The after-tax return earned by investors in the fifth year is 2.4 percent [ $=3 \%$ $-(0.20 \times 3 \%)]$. Inflation reduces the return by 2 percent so the after-tax real return earned by investors in the fifth year is 0.39 percent, as shown:

$$
\frac{(1+2.40 \%)}{(1+2.00 \%)}-1=\frac{(1+0.0240)}{(1+0.0200)}-1=1.0039-1=0.0039=0.39 \% .
$$

Note that taxes are paid before adjusting for inflation.

## Leveraged Return

In the previous calculations, we have assumed that the investor's position in an asset is equal to the total investment made by an investor using his or her own money. This section differs in that the investor creates a leveraged position.

There are two ways of creating a claim on asset returns that are greater than the investment of one's own money. First, an investor may trade futures contracts in which the money required to take a position may be as little as 10 percent of the notional value of the asset. In this case, the leveraged return, the return on the investor's own money, is 10 times the actual return of the underlying security. Both the gains and losses are amplified by a factor of 10 .

Investors can also invest more than their own money by borrowing money to purchase the asset. This approach is easily done in stocks and bonds, and very common when investing in real estate. If half ( 50 percent) of the money invested is borrowed, then the gross return to the investor is doubled, but the interest to be paid on borrowed money must be deducted to calculate the net return.

Using borrowed capital, debt, the size of the leveraged position increases by the additional, borrowed capital. If the total investment return earned on the leveraged portfolio, $R_{P}$, exceeds the borrowing cost on debt, $r_{D}$, taking on leverage increases the return on the portfolio. Denoting the return on a leveraged portfolio as $R_{L}$, then the return can be calculated as follows:

$$
R_{L}=\frac{\text { Portfolio return }}{\text { Portfolio equity }}=\frac{\left[R_{P} \times\left(V_{E}+V_{B}\right)-\left(V_{B} \times r_{D}\right)\right]}{V_{E}}=R_{p}+\frac{V_{B}}{V_{E}}\left(R_{p}-r_{D}\right),
$$

where $V_{E}$ is the equity of the portfolio and $V_{B}$ is the debt or borrowed funds. If $R_{P}<\mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{D}}$ then leverage decreases $R_{L}$.

For example, for a EUR10 million equity portfolio that generates an 8 percent total investment return, $R_{P}$, over one year and is financed 30 percent with debt at 5 percent, then the leveraged return, $R_{L}$, is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& R_{L}=R_{p}+\frac{V_{B}}{V_{E}}\left(R_{p}-r_{D}\right)=8 \%+\frac{\text { EUR3 million }}{\text { EUR7 million }}(8 \%-5 \%)=8 \%+0.43 \times 3 \% \\
& =9.29 \%
\end{aligned}
$$
