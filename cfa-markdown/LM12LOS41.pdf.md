## MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION

explain supply and demand relationships under monopolistic competition, including the optimal price and output for firms as well as pricing strategy

Many market structures exhibit characteristics of strong competitive forces; however, other distinct non-competitive factors can also play important roles in the market. As the name implies, monopolistic competition is a hybrid market. The most distinctive factor in monopolistic competition is product differentiation. Recall the characteristics outlined earlier:

1. The market has a large number of potential buyers and sellers.
2. The products offered by each seller are close substitutes for the products offered by other firms, and each firm tries to make its product look different.
3. Entry into and exit from the market are possible with fairly low costs.
4. Firms have some pricing power.
5. Suppliers differentiate their products through advertising and other nonprice strategies.

While the market is made up of many firms that compose the product group, each producer attempts to distinguish its product from that of the others. Product differentiation is accomplished in a variety of ways. For example, consider the wide variety of communication devices available today. Decades ago, when each communication
market was controlled by a regulated single seller (the telephone company), all telephones were alike. In today's deregulated market, the variety of physical styles and colors is extensive. All versions accomplish many of the same tasks.

The communication device manufacturers and providers differentiate their products with different colors, styles, networks, bundled applications, conditional contracts, functionality, and more. Advertising is usually the avenue pursued to convince consumers that the goods in the product group are different. Successful advertising and trademark branding result in customer loyalty. A good example is the brand loyalty associated with Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Harley-Davidson's customers believe that their motorcycles are truly different from and better than all other motorcycles.

The extent to which the producer is successful in product differentiation determines pricing power in the market. Very successful differentiation results in a market structure that resembles the single-seller market (monopoly). Because of relatively low entry and exit costs, competition will, in the long run, drive prices and revenues down toward an equilibrium similar to perfect competition. Thus, the hybrid market displays characteristics found in both perfectly competitive and monopoly markets.

## Demand Analysis in Monopolistically Competitive Markets

Because each good sold in the product group is somewhat different from the others, the demand curve for each firm in the monopolistic competition market structure is downward sloping to the right. Price and the quantity demanded are negatively related. Lowering the price will increase the quantity demanded and raising the price will decrease the quantity demanded. There will be ranges of prices within which demand is elastic and (lower) prices at which demand is inelastic. Exhibit 14 illustrates the demand, marginal revenue, and cost structures facing a monopolistically competitive firm in the short run.

In the short run, the profit-maximizing choice is the level of output at which MR = MC. Because the product is somewhat different from that of the competitors, the firm can charge the price determined by the demand curve. Therefore, in Exhibit 14, $Q_{1}$ is the ideal level of output and $P_{1}$ is the price consumers are willing to pay to acquire that quantity. Total revenue is the area of the rectangle $P_{1} \times Q_{1}$.

## Supply Analysis in Monopolistically Competitive Markets

In perfect competition, the firm's supply schedule is represented by the marginal cost schedule. In monopolistic competition, there is no well-defined supply function. The information used to determine the appropriate level of output is based on the intersection of MC and MR. However, the price that will be charged is based on the market demand schedule. The firm's supply curve should measure the quantity the firm is willing to supply at various prices. That information is not represented by either marginal cost or average cost.

## Optimal Price and Output in Monopolistically Competitive Markets

In the short run, the profit-maximizing choice is the level of output at which MR = MC and total revenue is the area of the rectangle $P_{1} \times Q_{1}$ shown in Exhibit 14.

The average cost of producing $Q_{1}$ units of the product is $C_{1}$, and the total cost is the area of the rectangle $C_{1} \times Q_{1}$. The difference between TR and TC is economic profit. The profit relationship is described as follows:
$\pi=\mathrm{TR}-\mathrm{TC}$,
where $\pi$ is total profit, TR is total revenue, and TC is total cost.

## THE BENEFITS OF IMPERFECT COMPETITION

Is monopolistic competition indeed imperfect-that is, is it a bad thing? At first, one would say that it is an inefficient market structure because prices are higher and the quantity supplied is less than in perfect competition. At the same time, in the real world, we see more markets characterized by monopolistic competition than markets meeting the strict conditions of perfect competition. If monopolistic competition were that inefficient, one wonders, why would it be so common?

A part of the explanation goes back to Schumpeter. Firms try to differentiate their products to meet the needs of customers. Differentiation provides a profit incentive to innovate, experiment with new products and services, and potentially improve the standard of living.

Moreover, because each customer has differing tastes and preferences, slight variations of each good or service are likely to capture the niche of the market that prefers them. An example is the market for candy, where one can find chocolate, licorice, mint, fruit, and many other flavors.

Another reason why monopolistic competition may be good is that people like variety. Traditional economic theories of international trade suggested that countries should buy products from other countries that they cannot produce domestically. Therefore, Norway should buy bananas from a tropical country and sell crude oil in exchange. But this is not the only kind of exchange that happens in reality: For example, Germany imports Honda, Subaru, and Toyota cars from Japan and sells Volkswagen, Porsche, Mercedes, and BMW cars to Japan. In theory, this should not occur because each of the countries produces good cars domestically and does not need to import them. The truth, however, is that consumers in both countries enjoy variety. Some Japanese drivers prefer to be at the steering wheel of a BMW; others like Hondas, and the same happens in Germany. Variety and product differentiation, therefore, are not necessarily bad things.

## Long-Run Equilibrium in Monopolistic Competition

Because total cost includes all costs associated with production, including opportunity cost, economic profit is a signal to the market, and that signal will attract more competition. Just as with the perfectly competitive market structure, with relatively low entry costs, more firms will enter the market and lure some customers away from the firm making an economic profit. The loss of customers to new entrant firms will drive down the demand for all firms producing similar products. In the long run for the monopolistically competitive firm, economic profit will fall to zero. Exhibit 15 illustrates the condition of long-run equilibrium for monopolistic competition.

Exhibit 15: Long-Run Equilibrium in Monopolistic Competition

In long-run equilibrium, output is still optimal at the level at which $M R=M C$, which is $Q_{1}$ in Exhibit 15. Again, the price consumers are willing to pay for any amount of the product is determined from the demand curve. That price is $P_{1}$ for the quantity $Q_{1}$ in Exhibit 15, and total revenue is the area of the rectangle $P_{1} \times Q_{1}$. Notice that unlike long-run equilibrium in perfect competition, in the market of monopolistic competition, the equilibrium position is at a higher level of average cost than the level of output that minimizes average cost. Average cost does not reach its minimum until output level $Q_{2}$ is achieved. Total cost in this long-run equilibrium position is the area of the rectangle $C_{1} \times Q_{1}$. Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost. In Exhibit 15 , economic profit is zero because total revenue equals total cost: $P_{1} \times Q_{1}=C_{1} \times Q_{1}$.

In the hybrid market of monopolistic competition, zero economic profit in long-run equilibrium resembles perfect competition. However, the long-run level of output, $Q_{1}$, is less than $Q_{2}$, which corresponds to the minimum average cost of production and would be the long-run level of output in a perfectly competitive market. In addition, the economic cost in monopolistic competition includes some cost associated with product differentiation, such as advertising. In perfect competition, no costs are associated with advertising or marketing because all products are homogeneous. Prices are lower, but consumers may have little variety.

## QUESTION SET

1. A company doing business in a monopolistically competitive market will most likely maximize profits when its output quantity is set such that:
A. average cost is minimized.
B. marginal revenue is equal to average cost.
C. marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.

Solution:
C is correct. The profit maximizing choice is the level of output at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

## OLIGOPOLY

explain supply and demand relationships under oligopoly, including the optimal price and output for firms as well as pricing strategy

## Oligopoly and Pricing Strategies

An oligopoly market structure is characterized by only a few firms doing business in a relevant market. The products must all be similar and generally are substitutes for one another. In some oligopoly markets, the goods or services may be differentiated by marketing and strong brand recognition, as in the markets for breakfast cereals and for bottled or canned beverages. Other examples of oligopoly markets are made up of homogeneous products with little or no attempt at product differentiation, such as petroleum and cement. The most distinctive characteristic of oligopoly markets is the small number of firms that dominate the market. There are so few firms in the relevant market that their pricing decisions are interdependent. That is, each firm's pricing decision is based on the expected retaliation by the other firms. Recall the characteristics of oligopoly markets:

1. There are a small number of potential sellers.
2. The products offered by each seller are close substitutes for the products offered by other firms and may be differentiated by brand or homogeneous and unbranded.
3. Entry into the market is difficult, with fairly high costs and significant barriers to competition.
4. Firms typically have substantial pricing power.
5. Products are often highly differentiated through marketing, features, and other non-price strategies.

Because there are so few firms, each firm can have some degree of pricing power, which can result in substantial profits. Another by-product of the oligopoly market structure is the attractiveness of price collusion. Even without price collusion, a dominant firm may easily become the price maker in the market.
