## Inflation Targeting

Throughout the 1990s, a consensus began to build among both central bankers and politicians that the best way to control inflation and thereby maintain price stability was to target a certain level of inflation and to ensure that this target was met by monitoring a wide range of monetary, financial, and real economic variables. Today, inflation-targeting frameworks are the cornerstone of monetary policy and macroeconomic policy in many economies. Exhibit 4 shows the growth in the number of inflation-targeting monetary policy regimes over time.

The inflation-targeting framework that is now commonly practiced was pioneered in New Zealand. In 1988, the New Zealand Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas, announced that economic policy would focus on bringing inflation down from the prevailing level of around 6 percent to a target range of 0 to 2 percent. This goal was given legal status by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989. As part of the Act, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) was given the role of pursuing this target. The bank was given operational independence; it was free to set interest rates in the way that it thought would best meet the inflation target. Although the RBNZ had independent control of monetary policy, it was still accountable to the government and was charged with communicating its decisions in a clear and transparent way. As Exhibit 4 shows, the New Zealand model was widely copied.

Although these inflation-targeting regimes vary a little from economy to economy, their success is thought to depend on three key concepts: central bank independence, credibility, and transparency.

## Central Bank Independence

In most cases, the central bank that is charged with targeting inflation has a degree of independence from its government. This independence is thought to be important. It is conceivable that politicians could announce an inflation target and direct the central bank to set interest rates accordingly. Indeed, this was the process adopted in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 1997. But politicians have a constant eye on reelection and might be tempted, for example, to keep rates "too low" in the lead-up to an election in the hope that this might help their reelection prospects. As a consequence, this might lead to higher inflation. Thus, it is now widely believed that monetary policy decisions should rest in the hands of an organization that is remote from the electoral process. The central bank is the natural candidate to be the monopoly supplier of a currency.

However, there are degrees of independence. For example, the head of the central bank is nearly always chosen by government officials. The chair of the US Federal Reserve's Board of Governors is appointed by the president of the United States of America; the head of the ECB is chosen by the committee of Euro area finance ministers; and the governor of the Bank of England is chosen by the chancellor of the exchequer. So, in practice, separating control from political influence completely is probably an impossible (although a desirable) goal.

There are further degrees of independence. Some central banks are both operationally and target independent. This means that they not only decide the level of interest rates but also determine the definition of inflation that they target, the rate of inflation that they target, and the horizon over which the target is to be achieved. The ECB has independence of this kind. By contrast, other central banks-including those in New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom-are tasked to hit a definition and level of inflation determined by the government. Therefore, these central banks are only operationally independent.

## Credibility

The independence of the central bank and public confidence in it are key in the design of an inflation-targeting regime.

To illustrate the role of credibility, suppose that instead of the central bank, the government assumes the role of targeting inflation, but the government is heavily indebted. Given that higher inflation reduces the real value of debt, the government would have an incentive to avoid reaching the inflation target or to set a high inflation target such that price stability and confidence in the currency could be endangered. As a result, few would believe the government was really intent on controlling inflation; thus, the government would lack credibility. Many governments have very large levels of debt, especially since the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis. In such a situation,
economic agents might expect a high level of inflation, regardless of the actual, stated target. The target might have little credibility if the organization's likelihood of sticking to it is in doubt.

If a respected central bank assumes the inflation-targeting role and if economic agents believe that the central bank will hit its target, this belief could become self-fulfilling. If everyone believes that the central bank will hit an inflation target of 2 percent next year, this expectation might be built into wage claims and other nominal contracts that would make it hit the 2 percent target. For this reason, central bankers pay a great deal of attention to inflation expectations. If these expectations were to rise rapidly, perhaps following a rapid increase in oil prices, unchecked expectations could get embedded into wage claims and eventually cause inflation to rise.

## Transparency

One way to establish credibility is for a central bank to be transparent in its decision making. Many, if not all, independent inflation-targeting central banks produce a quarterly assessment of their economies. These inflation reports, as they are usually known, give central banks' views on the range of indicators that they watch when they come to their (usually) monthly interest rate decision. They will consider and outline their views on the following subjects, usually in this order:

- Broad money aggregates and credit conditions;
- Conditions in financial markets;
- Developments in the real economy (e.g., the labor market); and
- Evolution of prices.

Consideration of all of these important components of an economy is then usually followed by a forecast of growth and inflation over a medium-term horizon, usually two years.

By explaining their views on the economy and by being transparent in decision making, the independent, inflation-targeting central banks seek to gain reputation and credibility, making it easier to influence inflation expectations and hence ultimately easier to meet the inflation target.

## The Target

Whether the target is set by the central bank or by the government for the central bank to hit, the level of the target and the horizon over which the target is to be hit is a crucial consideration in all inflation-targeting frameworks.

## Exhibit 5: A Range of Inflation Targets

| Australia | Australian Federal Reserve's target is inflation between 2\% and 3\%. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Canada | Bank of Canada's target is CPI inflation within the 1\% to 3\% range. |
| Euro area | ECB's target is CPI inflation close to, but below, a ceiling of 2\%. |
| South Korea | Bank of Korea's target since 2019 has been CPI inflation of 2\%. |
| New Zealand | The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's target is to keep future inflation between $1 \%$ and $3 \%$ with a focus on the average future inflation rate near 2\%. |

## Country/Region

| Sweden | Riksbank's target is CPI inflation within $\pm 1.0$ percentage point of $2 \%$. |
| :--- | :--- |
| United Kingdom | Bank of England's target is CPI inflation within $\pm 1.0$ percentage point <br> of $2 \%$. |

Note: CPI, consumer price index.
Source: Central bank websites (http://www.bis.org/cbanks.htm).
Exhibit 5 shows that many central banks in developed economies target an inflation rate of 2 percent based on a consumer price index (CPI). Given that the operation of monetary policy is both art and science, the banks are normally allowed a range around the central target of +1 percent or -1 percent. For example, with a 2 percent target, they would be tasked to keep inflation between 1 percent and 3 percent. But why target 2 percent and not 0 percent?

The answer is that aiming to hit 0 percent could result in negative inflation, known as deflation. One of the limitations of monetary policy that we will discuss is its ability or inability to deal with periods of deflation. If deflation is something to be avoided, why not target 10 percent? The answer to this question is that levels of inflation that high would not be consistent with price stability; such a high inflation rate would further tend to be associated with high inflation volatility and uncertainty. Central bankers seem to agree that 2 percent is far enough away from the risks of deflation and low enough not to lead to destabilizing inflation shocks.

Finally, we should keep in mind that the headline inflation rate that is announced in most economies every month, and which is the central bank's target, is a measure of how much a basket of goods and services has risen over the previous twelve months. It is history. Furthermore, interest rate changes made today will take some time to have their full effect on the real economy as they make their way through the monetary transmission mechanism. It is for these two reasons that inflation targeters do not target current inflation but instead usually focus on inflation two years ahead.

Although inflation-targeting mandates may vary from country to country, they have common elements: the specification of an explicit inflation target, with permissible bounds, and a requirement that the central bank should be transparent in its objectives and policy actions. This is all usually laid out in legislation that imposes statutory obligations on the central bank. As mentioned earlier, New Zealand pioneered the inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy that has since been copied widely. New Zealand's Policy Targets Agreement, which specifies the inflation-targeting mandate of its central bank, the RBNZ, is included in Example 2.

## EXAMPLE 2

## New Zealand's Policy Targets Agreement

"This agreement between the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (the Bank) is made under section 9 of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989 (the Act). The Minister and the Governor agree as follows:

## Price stability

a. Under Section 8 of the Act the Reserve Bank is required to conduct monetary policy with the goal of maintaining a stable general level of prices.
b. The Government's economic objective is to promote a growing, open and competitive economy as the best means of delivering permanently higher incomes and living standards for New Zealanders. Price stability plays an important part in supporting this objective.

## Policy target

a. In pursuing the objective of a stable general level of prices, the Bank shall monitor prices as measured by a range of price indexes. The price stability target will be defined in terms of the All Groups Consumers Price Index (CPI), as published by Statistics New Zealand.
b. For the purpose of this agreement, the policy target shall be to keep future CPI inflation outcomes between 1 per cent and 3 per cent on average over the medium term.

## Inflation variations around target

a. For a variety of reasons, the actual annual rate of CPI inflation will vary around the medium-term trend of inflation, which is the focus of the policy target. Amongst these reasons, there is a range of events whose impact would normally be temporary. Such events include, for example, shifts in the aggregate price level as a result of exceptional movements in the prices of commodities traded in world markets, changes in indirect taxes, ${ }^{9}$ significant government policy changes that directly affect prices, or a natural disaster affecting a major part of the economy.
b. When disturbances of the kind described in clause 3(a) arise, the Bank will respond consistent with meeting its medium-term target.

## Communication, implementation, and accountability

a. On occasions when the annual rate of inflation is outside the medi-um-term target range, or when such occasions are projected, the Bank shall explain in Policy Statements made under section 15 of the Act why such outcomes have occurred, or are projected to occur, and what measures it has taken, or proposes to take, to ensure that inflation outcomes remain consistent with the medium-term target.
b. In pursuing its price stability objective, the Bank shall implement monetary policy in a sustainable, consistent, and transparent manner and shall seek to avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates and the exchange rate.
c. The Bank shall be fully accountable for its judgments and actions in implementing monetary policy."

To summarize, an inflation-targeting framework normally has the following features:

- An independent and credible central bank;
- A commitment to transparency;
- A decision-making framework that considers a wide range of economic and financial market indicators; and
- A clear, symmetric, and forward-looking medium-term inflation target, sufficiently above 0 percent to avoid the risk of deflation but low enough to ensure a significant degree of price stability.

Indeed, independence, credibility, and transparency are arguably the crucial ingredients for an effective central bank, whether or not they target inflation.

## The Main Exceptions to the Inflation-Targeting Rule

Although the practice of inflation targeting is widespread, two prominent central banks have not adopted a formal inflation target along the lines of the New Zealand model: the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the US Federal Reserve System.

## The Bank of Japan

Japan's central bank, the BoJ, does not target an explicit measure of inflation. Japan's government and its monetary authorities have been trying to combat deflation for much of the past two decades. However, despite their efforts-including the outright printing of money-inflation has remained very weak. Inflation targeting is seen very much as a way of combating and controlling inflation; as such, it would seem to have no place in an economy that suffers from persistent deflation.

Some economists have argued, however, that an inflation target is exactly what the Japanese economy needs. By announcing that positive inflation of say 3 percent is desired by the central bank, this might become a self-fulfilling prophecy if Japanese consumers and companies factor this target into nominal wage and price contracts. But for economic agents to believe that the target will be achieved, they have to believe that the central bank is capable of achieving it. Given that the BoJ has failed to engineer persistent, positive inflation, it is debatable how much credibility Japanese households and corporations would afford such an inflation-targeting policy.

## The US Federal Reserve System

It is perhaps rather ironic that the world's most influential central bank, the US Federal Reserve, which controls the supply of the world's de facto reserve currency, the US dollar, does not have an explicit inflation target. However, it is felt that the single-minded pursuit of inflation might not be compatible with the Fed's statutory goal as laid out in the Federal Reserve Act, which charges the Fed's board to: "promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."

In other words, it has been argued that inflation targeting might compromise the goal of "maximum employment." In practice, however, the Fed has indicated that it sees core inflation measured by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator of about, or just below, 2 percent as being compatible with "stable prices." Financial markets therefore watch this US inflation gauge very carefully to anticipate the rate actions of the Fed.

## Monetary Policy in Developing Countries

Developing economies often face significant impediments to the successful operation of any monetary policy-that is, the achievement of price stability. These include:

- the absence of a sufficiently liquid government bond market and developed interbank market through which monetary policy can be conducted;
- a rapidly changing economy, making it difficult to understand what the neutral rate might be and what the equilibrium relationship between monetary aggregates and the real economy might be;
- rapid financial innovation that frequently changes the definition of the money supply;
- a poor track record in controlling inflation in the past, making monetary policy intentions less credible; and
- an unwillingness of governments to grant genuine independence to the central bank.

Taken together, any or all of these impediments might call into question the effectiveness of any developing economy's monetary policy framework, making any related monetary policy goals difficult to achieve.

1. The reason some inflation-targeting banks may target low inflation and not zero percent inflation is best described by which of the following statements?
A. Some inflation is viewed as being good for an economy.
B. It is very difficult to eliminate all inflation from a modern economy.
C. Targeting zero percent inflation runs a higher risk of a deflationary outcome.

## Solution:

C is correct. Inflation targeting is art, not science. Sometimes inflation will be above target and sometimes below. Were central banks to target zero percent, then inflation would almost certainly be negative on some occasions. If a deflationary mindset then sets in among economic agents, it might be difficult for the central bank to respond to this because they cannot cut interest rates much below zero.
2. The degree of credibility that a central bank is afforded by economic agents is important because:
A. they are the lender of last resort.
B. they set targets that can become self-fulfilling prophecies.
C. they are the monopolistic suppliers of the currency.

## Solution:

B is correct. If a central bank operates within an inflation-targeting regime and if economic agents believe that it will achieve its target, this expectation will become embedded into wage negotiations, for example, and become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Also, banks need to be confident that the central bank will lend them money when all other sources are closed to them; otherwise, they might curtail their lending drastically, leading to a commensurate reduction in money and economic activity.
3. A central bank that decides the desired levels of interest rates and inflation and the horizon over which the inflation objective is to be achieved is most accurately described as being:
A. target independent and operationally independent.
B. target independent but not operationally independent.
C. operationally independent but not target independent.

Solution:
A is correct. The central bank described is target independent because it set its own targets (e.g., the target inflation rate) and operationally independent because it decides how to achieve its targets (e.g., the time horizon).

## Exchange Rate Targeting

Many developing economies choose to operate monetary policy by targeting their currency's exchange rate, rather than an explicit level of domestic inflation. Such targeting involves setting a fixed level or band of values for the exchange rate against a major currency, with the central bank supporting the target by buying and selling the national currency in foreign exchange markets. There are recent examples of developed economies using such an approach. In the 1980s, following the failure of its policy of trying to control UK inflation by setting medium-term goals for money supply growth, the UK government decided to operate monetary policy such that the sterling's exchange rate equaled a predetermined value in terms of German deutschemarks. The basic idea is that by tying a domestic economy's currency to that of an economy with a credible policy of maintaining low inflation, the domestic economy would effectively "import" the inflation experience of the low-inflation economy.

Suppose that a developing country wished to maintain the value of its currency against the US dollar. The government or central bank would announce the currency exchange rate that they wished to target. To simplify matters, let us assume that the domestic inflation rates are very similar in both countries and that the monetary authorities of the developing economy have set an exchange rate target that is consistent with relative price levels in the two economies. Under these (admittedly unlikely) circumstances, in the absence of shocks, there would be no reason for the exchange rate to deviate significantly from this target level. As long as domestic inflation closely mirrors US inflation, the exchange rate should remain close to its target (or within a target band). It is in this sense that a successful exchange rate policy imports the inflation of the foreign economy.

Now suppose that economic activity in the developing economy starts to rise rapidly and that domestic inflation in the developing economy rises above the level in the United States. With a freely floating exchange rate regime, the currency of the developing economy would start to fall against the dollar. To arrest this fall, and to protect the exchange rate target, the developing economy's monetary authority sells foreign currency reserves and buys its own currency. This has the effect of reducing the domestic money supply and increasing short-term interest rates. The developing economy experiences a monetary policy tightening that, if expected to bring down inflation, will cause its exchange rate to rise against the dollar.

By contrast, in a scenario in which inflation in the developing country fell relative to the United States, the central bank would need to sell the domestic currency to support the target, tending to increase the domestic money supply and reduce the rate of interest.

In practice, the interventions of the developing economy central bank will simply stabilize the value of its currency, with many frequent adjustments. But this simplistic example should demonstrate one very important fact: When the central bank or monetary authority chooses to target an exchange rate, interest rates and conditions in the domestic economy must adapt to accommodate this target and domestic interest rates and money supply can become more volatile.

The monetary authority's commitment to and ability to support the exchange rate target must be credible for exchange rate targeting to be successful. If that is not the case, then speculators may trade against the monetary authority. Speculative attacks forced sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. The fixed exchange rate regime was abandoned, and the United Kingdom allowed its currency to float freely. Eventually, the UK government adopted a formal inflation target in 1997. Similarly, in the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, Thailand's central bank tried to defend the Thai baht against speculative attacks for much of the first half of 1997 but
then revealed at the beginning of July that it had no reserves left. The subsequent devaluation triggered a debt crisis for banks and companies that had borrowed in foreign currency, and contagion spread throughout Asia.

Despite these risks, many currencies are pegged to other currencies, most notably the US dollar. Exhibit 6 shows a list of some of the currencies that were pegged to (fixed against) the US dollar at the end of 2018. Other currencies operate under a "managed exchange rate policy," where they are allowed to fluctuate within a range that is maintained by a monetary authority through market intervention. Dollarization occurs when a country adopts the US dollar as their functional currency. This is stronger than pegging to the dollar because under dollarization, the US dollar replaces the previous national currency. Exhibit 6 breaks out countries that peg their currency to the dollar and those that have adopted the US dollar as their currency.

1. When the central bank chooses to target a specific value for its exchange rate:
A. it must also target domestic inflation.
B. it must also set targets for broad money growth.
C. conditions in the domestic economy must adapt to accommodate this target.

## Solution:

C is correct. The adoption of an exchange rate target requires that the central bank set interest rates to achieve this target. If the target comes under pressure, domestic interest rates may have to rise, regardless of domestic conditions. It may have a "target" level of inflation in mind as well as "targets" for broad money growth, but as long as it targets the exchange rate, domestic inflation and broad money trends must simply be allowed to evolve.
2. With regard to monetary policy, what is the expected benefit of adopting an exchange rate target?
A. Freedom to pursue redistributive fiscal policy
B. Freedom to set interest rates according to domestic conditions

| C. Ability to "import" the inflation experience of the economy whose currency is being targeted <br> Solution: <br> C is correct.

Rapid financial innovation <br> C. Absence of a liquid government bond market <br> Solution: <br> A is correct. Note that the absence of a liquid government bond market through which a central bank can enact open market operations and/or repo transactions will inhibit the implementation of monetary policy-as would rapid financial innovation because such innovation can change the relationship between money and economic activity. In contrast, fiscal deficits are not normally an impediment to the implementation of monetary policy, although they could be if they were perceived to be unsustainable. |

Interest rates are expected to rise to protect the exchange rate target. |

## Contractionary and Expansionary Monetary Policies and Their Limitations

Most central banks will adjust liquidity conditions by adjusting their official policy rate. When they believe that economic activity is likely to lead to an increase in inflation, they might increase interest rates, thereby reducing liquidity. In these cases, market analysts describe such actions as contractionary because the policy is designed to cause the rate of growth of the money supply and the real economy to contract (see Exhibit 3 for the possible transmission mechanism). Conversely, when the economy is slowing and inflation and monetary trends are weakening, central banks may increase liquidity by cutting their target rate. In these circumstances, monetary policy is said to be expansionary.

Thus, when policy rates are high, monetary policy may be described as contractionary; when low, it may be described as expansionary. But what are they "high" and "low" in comparison to?

The neutral rate of interest is often taken as the point of comparison. One way of characterizing the neutral rate is to say that it is that rate of interest that neither spurs on nor slows down the underlying economy. As such, when policy rates are
above the neutral rate, monetary policy is contractionary; when they are below the neutral rate, monetary policy is expansionary. The neutral rate should correspond to the average policy rate over a business cycle.

However, economists' views of the neutral rate for any given economy might differ, and therefore, their view of whether monetary policy is contractionary, neutral, or expansionary might differ too. What economists do agree on is that the neutral policy rate for any economy has two components:

- Real trend rate of growth of the underlying economy, and
- Long-run expected inflation.

The real trend rate of growth of an economy is also difficult to discern, but it corresponds to that rate of economic growth that is achievable in the long run that gives rise to stable inflation. If we are thinking about an economy with a credible inflation-targeting regime, where the inflation target is, say, 2 percent per year and where an analyst believes that the economy can grow sustainably over the long term at a rate of 2.5 percent per year, then they might also estimate the neutral rate to be:

Neutral rate $=$ Trend growth + Inflation target $=2.5 \%+2.0 \%=4.5 \%$
The analyst would therefore describe the central bank's monetary policy as being contractionary when its policy rate is above 4.5 percent and expansionary when it is below this level.

In practice, central banks often indicate what they believe to be the neutral rate of interest for their economy too. But determining this "neutral rate" is more art than science. For example, many analysts have recently revised down their estimates of trend growth for many western countries following the collapse of the credit bubble, because in many cases, the governments and private individuals of these economies are now being forced to reduce consumption levels and pay down their debts.

## What's the Source of the Shock to the Inflation Rate?

An important aspect of monetary policy for those charged with its conduct is the determination of the source of any shock to the inflation rate. Suppose that the monetary authority sees that inflation is rising beyond its target, or simply in a way that threatens price stability. If this rise was caused by an increase in the confidence of consumers and business leaders, which in turn has led to increases in consumption and investment growth rates, then we could think of it as being a demand shock. In this instance, it might be appropriate to tighten monetary policy to bring the inflationary pressures generated by these domestic demand pressures under control.

However, suppose instead that the rise in inflation was caused by a rise in the price of oil (for the sake of argument). In this case, the economy is facing a supply shock, and raising interest rates might make a bad situation worse. Consumers are already facing an increase in the cost of fuel prices that might cause profits and consumption to fall and eventually unemployment to rise. Putting up interest rates in this instance might simply exacerbate the oil price-induced downturn, which ultimately might cause inflation to fall sharply.

It is important, then, for the monetary authority to try to identify the source of the shock before engineering a contractionary or expansionary monetary policy phase.

## Limitations of Monetary Policy

The limitations of monetary policy include problems in the transmission mechanism and the relative ineffectiveness of interest rate adjustment as a policy tool in deflationary environments.

## Problems in the Monetary Transmission Mechanism

In Exhibit 3, we presented a stylized representation of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, including the channels of bank lending rates, asset prices, expectations, and exchange rates. The implication of the diagram is that there are channels through which the actions of the central bank or monetary authority are transmitted to both the nominal and real economy. In some occasions, however, the will of the monetary authority is not transmitted seamlessly through the economy.

Suppose that a central bank raises interest rates because it is concerned about the strength of underlying inflationary pressures. Long-term interest rates are influenced by the path of expected short-term interest rates, so the outcome of the rate hike will depend on market expectations. Suppose that bond market participants think that short-term rates are already too high, that the monetary authorities are risking a recession, and that the central bank will likely undershoot its inflation target. This fall in inflation expectations could cause long-term interest rates to fall. That would make long-term borrowing cheaper for companies and households, which could in turn stimulate economic activity rather than cause it to contract.

Arguably, the more credible the monetary authority, the more stable the long end of the yield curve; moreover, the monetary authority will be more confident that its "policy message" will be transmitted throughout the economy. A term recently used in the marketplace is bond market vigilantes. These "vigilantes" are bond market participants who might reduce their demand for long-term bonds, thus pushing up their yields, if they believe that the monetary authority is losing its grip on inflation. That yield increase could act as a brake on any loose monetary policy stance. Conversely, the vigilantes may push long-term rates down by increasing their demand for long-dated government bonds if they expect that tight monetary policy is likely to cause a sharp slowdown in the economy, thereby loosening monetary conditions for long-term borrowers in the economy.

A credible monetary policy framework and authority will tend not to require the vigilantes to do the work for it.

In very extreme instances, there may be occasions in which the demand for money becomes infinitely elastic-that is, where the demand curve is horizontal and individuals are willing to hold additional money balances without any change in the interest rate-so that further injections of money into the economy will not serve to further lower interest rates or affect real activity. This is known as a liquidity trap. In this extreme circumstance, monetary policy can become completely ineffective. The economic conditions for a liquidity trap are associated with the phenomenon of deflation.

## Interest Rate Adjustment in a Deflationary Environment and Quantitative Easing as a Response

Deflation is a pervasive and persistent fall in a general price index and is more difficult for conventional monetary policy to deal with than inflation. This is because cutting nominal interest rates much below zero to stimulate the economy is difficult. For example, policy interest rates were cut below zero in several European countries in 2014 and subsequently in Japan in 2016. At this point, the economic conditions for a liquidity trap arise.

Deflation raises the real value of debt, while the persistent fall in prices can encourage consumers to put off consumption today, leading to a fall in demand that leads to further deflationary pressure. Thus a deflationary "trap" can develop, which is characterized by weak consumption growth, falling prices, and increases in real debt levels. Japan eventually found itself in such a position following the collapse of its property bubble in the early 1990s.

If conventional monetary policy-the adjustment of short-term interest rates-is no longer capable of stimulating the economy once the zero or even negative nominal interest rate bound has been reached, is monetary policy useless?

In the aftermath of the collapse of the high-tech bubble in November 2002, Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke gave a speech entitled "Deflation: Making Sure 'It' Doesn't Happen Here." In this speech, Bernanke stated that inflation was always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, and he expressed great confidence that by expanding the money supply by various means (including dropping it out of a helicopter on the population below), the Federal Reserve as the sole supplier of money could always engineer positive inflation in the US economy. He said:

I am confident that the Fed would take whatever means necessary to prevent significant deflation in the United States and, moreover, that the US central bank, in cooperation with other parts of the government as needed, has sufficient policy instruments to ensure that any deflation that might occur would be both mild and brief.

Following the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis, a number of governments along with their central banks cut rates to (near) zero, including those in the United States and the United Kingdom. However, there was concern that the underlying economies might not respond to this drastic monetary medicine, mainly because the related banking crisis had caused banks to reduce their lending drastically. To kick-start the process, both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England effectively printed money and pumped it into their respective economies. This "unconventional" approach to monetary policy, known as quantitative easing (QE), is operationally similar to open market purchase operations but is conducted on a much larger scale.

The additional reserves created by central banks in a policy of quantitative easing can be used to buy any assets. The Bank of England chose to buy gilts (bonds issued by the UK government), where the focus was on gilts with three to five years maturity. The idea was that this additional reserve would kick-start lending, causing broad money growth to expand, which would eventually lead to an increase in real economic activity. But there is no guarantee that banks will respond in this way. In a difficult economic climate, it may be better to hold excess reserves rather than to lend to households and businesses that may default.

In the United States, the formal plan for QE mainly involved the purchase of mortgage bonds issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Part of the intention was to push down mortgage rates to support the US housing market, as well as to increase the growth rate of broad money. Before implementing this formal program, the Federal Reserve intervened in several other markets that were failing for lack of liquidity, including interbank markets and the commercial paper market. These interventions had a similar effect on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and the money supply as the later QE program.

This first round of QE by the Federal Reserve was then followed by another round of QE, known as QE2. In November 2010, the Federal Reserve judged that the US economy had not responded sufficiently to the first round of QE (QE1). The Fed announced that it would create $\$ 600$ billion and use this money to purchase long-dated US Treasuries in equal tranches over the following eight months. The purpose of QE2 was to ensure that long bond yields remained low to encourage businesses and households to borrow for investment and consumption purposes, respectively.

The final round of QE, known as QE3, was implemented in September 2012 to provide $\$ 40$ billion per month to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities "until the labor market improved substantially." QE3 lasted until December 2013, when the Federal Reserve announced it was tapering back on these purchases. These purchases, and quantitative easing, ended 10 months later in October 2014.

As long as central banks have the appropriate authority from the government, they can purchase any assets in a quantitative easing program. But the risks involved in purchasing assets with credit risk should be clear. In the end, the central bank is just a special bank. If it accumulates bad assets that then turn out to create losses, it could face a fatal loss of confidence in its main product: fiat money.

## Limitations of Monetary Policy: Summary

The ultimate problem for monetary authorities as they try to manipulate the supply of money to influence the real economy is that they cannot control the amount of money that households and corporations put in banks on deposit, nor can they easily control the willingness of banks to create money by expanding credit. Taken together, this also means that they cannot always control the money supply. Therefore, there are definite limits to the power of monetary policy.

## The Limits of Monetary Policy: The Case of Japan

## The Background

Between the 1950s and 1980s, Japan's economy achieved faster real growth than any other G-7 economy. But the terrific success of the economy sowed the seeds of the problems that were to follow. The very high real growth rates achieved by Japan over four decades became built into asset prices, particularly equity and commercial property prices. Toward the end of the 1980s, asset prices rose to even higher levels when the BoJ followed a very easy monetary policy as it tried to prevent the Japanese yen from appreciating too much against the US dollar. However, when interest rates went up in 1989-1990 and the economy slowed, investors eventually came to believe that the growth assumptions that were built into asset prices and other aspects of the Japanese economy were unrealistic. This realization caused Japanese asset prices to collapse. For example, the Nikkei 225 stock market index reached 38,915 in 1989; by the end of March 2003, it had fallen by 80 percent to 7,972 . The collapse in asset prices caused wealth to decline dramatically. Consumer confidence understandably fell sharply too, and consumption growth slowed. Corporate spending also fell, while bank lending contracted sharply in the weak economic climate. Although many of these phenomena are apparent in all recessions, the situation was made worse when deflation set in. In an environment when prices are falling, consumers may put off discretionary spending today until tomorrow; by doing this, however, they exacerbate the deflationary environment. Deflation also raises the real value of debts; as deflation takes hold, borrowers find the real value of their debts rising and may try to increase their savings accordingly. Once again, such actions exacerbate the recessionary conditions.

## The Monetary Policy Response

Faced with such a downturn, the conventional monetary policy response is to cut interest rates to try to stimulate real economic activity. The Japanese central bank, the BoJ, cut rates from 8 percent in 1990 to 1 percent by 1996. By February 2001, the Japanese policy rate was cut to zero where it stayed.

Once rates are at or near zero, there are two broad approaches suggested by theory, though the two are usually complementary. First, the central bank can try to convince markets that interest rates will remain low for a long time, even after the economy and inflation pick up. This will tend to lower interest rates along the yield curve. Second, the central bank can try to increase the money
supply by purchasing assets from the private sector, so-called quantitative easing. The BoJ did both in 2001. It embarked on a program of quantitative easing supplemented by an explicit promise not to raise short-term interest rates until deflation had given way to inflation.

Quantitative easing simply involves the printing of money by the central bank. In practice, this involved the BoJ using open market operations to add reserves to the banking system through the direct purchase of government securities in the open market.

The reserve levels became the new target. The BoJ's monetary policy committee determined the level of reserves and the quantity of bond purchases that should be undertaken, rather than voting on the policy rate.

The success of this policy is difficult to judge. As Exhibit 7 shows, although deflation turned to inflation for a while, it returned to deflation in 2008-2009 when the Japanese economy suffered a sharp recession along with much of the rest of the world. At that time, having reversed its QE policy during 2004-2008 by reducing its bond holdings, the BoJ began to buy again.

The BoJ ramped up its asset purchases starting in 2013, when other central banks began to unwind their QE programs. At the beginning of 2013, BoJ Assets to Japanese GDP were approximately 30 percent, but rose to more than 170 percent in 2020. Economists debate the point, but arguably, even the BoJ's much larger program of QE has not been able to eliminate deflation. The Japanese experience suggests that there may be limits to the power of monetary policy.

## QUESTION SET

1. If an economy's trend GDP growth rate is 3 percent and its central bank has a 2 percent inflation target, which policy rate is most consistent with an expansionary monetary policy?
A. 4 percent
B. 5 percent
C. 6 percent

Solution:
A is correct. The neutral rate of interest, which in this example is 5 percent, is considered to be that rate of interest that neither spurs on nor slows down the underlying economy. As such, when policy rates are above the neutral rate, monetary policy is contractionary; when they are below the neutral rate, monetary policy is expansionary. It has two components: the real trend rate of growth of the underlying economy (in this example, 3 percent) and long-run expected inflation (in this example, 2 percent).
2. An increase in a central bank's policy rate might be expected to reduce inflationary pressures by:
A. reducing consumer demand.
B. reducing the foreign exchange value of the currency.
C. driving up asset prices leading to an increase in personal sector wealth.

## Solution:

A is correct. If an increase in the central bank's policy rate is successfully transmitted through the money markets to other parts of the financial sector, consumer demand might decline as the rate of interest on mortgages and other credit rises. This decline in consumer demand should, all other things being equal and among other affects, lead to a reduction in upward pressure on consumer prices.
3. Which of the following statements best describes a fundamental limitation of monetary policy? Monetary policy is limited because central bankers:
A. cannot control the inflation rate perfectly.
B. are appointed by politicians and are therefore never truly independent.
C. cannot control the amount of money that economic agents put in banks, nor the willingness of banks to make loans.
Solution:
C is correct. Central bankers do not control the decisions of individuals and banks that can influence the money creation process.
4. In theory, setting the policy rate equal to the neutral interest rate should promote:
A. stable inflation.
B. balanced budgets.

## C. greater employment. <br> Solution:

A is correct. The neutral rate of interest is that rate of interest that neither stimulates nor slows down the underlying economy. The neutral rate should be consistent with stable long-run inflation.

## INTERACTION OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY

explain the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy

## The Relationship Between Monetary and Fiscal Policy

Both monetary and fiscal policies can be used to try to influence the macroeconomy. But the impact of monetary policy on aggregate demand may differ depending on the fiscal policy stance. Conversely, the impact of fiscal policy might vary under various alternative monetary policy conditions. Clearly, policy makers need to understand this interaction. For example, they need to consider the impact of changes to the budget when monetary policy is accommodative as opposed to when it is restrictive: Can we expect the same impact on aggregate demand in both situations?

Although both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand, they do so through differing channels with differing impact on the composition of aggregate demand. The two policies are not interchangeable. Consider the following cases in which the assumption is made that wages and prices are rigid:

- Easy fiscal policy/tight monetary policy: If taxes are cut or government spending rises, the expansionary fiscal policy will lead to a rise in aggregate output. If this is accompanied by a reduction in money supply to offset the fiscal expansion, then interest rates will rise and have a negative effect on private sector demand. We have higher output and higher interest rates, and government spending will be a larger proportion of overall national income.
- Tight fiscal policy/easy monetary policy: If a fiscal contraction is accompanied by expansionary monetary policy and low interest rates, then the private sector will be stimulated and will rise as a share of GDP, while the public sector will shrink.
- Easy monetary policy/easy fiscal policy: If both fiscal and monetary policy are easy, then the joint impact will be highly expansionary-leading to a rise in aggregate demand, lower interest rates (at least if the monetary impact is larger), and growing private and public sectors.
- Tight monetary policy/tight fiscal policy: Interest rates rise (at least if the monetary impact on interest rates is larger) and reduce private demand. At the same time, higher taxes and falling government spending lead to a drop in aggregate demand from both public and private sectors.
