3. What would happen to the lumber industry workers in Cottonland in the long run?

## Solution:

The overall welfare effect in both countries is positive. However, in the short run, many lumber producers in Cottonland (and cotton producers in Lumberland) are likely to find themselves without jobs as the lumber industry in Cottonland and the cotton industry in Lumberland contract. Those with skills that also are needed in the other industry may find jobs fairly quickly. Others are likely to do so after some re-training. In the long run, displaced workers should be able to find jobs in the expanding export industry. Those who remain in the import-competing industry, however, may be permanently worse off because their industry-specific skills are now less valuable. Thus, even in the long run, trade does not necessarily make every stakeholder better off. But the winners could compensate the losers and still be better off, so the overall welfare effect of opening trade is positive.
4. What is the meaning of the expression "gains from trade"?

## Solution:

Gains from trade imply that the overall benefits of trade outweigh the losses from trade. It does not mean that all stakeholders (producers, consumers, government) benefit (or benefit equally) from trade.
5. What are some of the benefits from trade?

## Solution:

Some of the benefits from trade include the following: gains from exchange and specialization based on relative cost advantage; gains from economies of scale as the companies add new markets for their products; greater variety of products available to households and firms; greater efficiency from increased competition; and more efficient allocation of resources.

## TRADE RESTRICTIONS AND AGREEMENTS-TARIFFS, QUOTAS, AND EXPORT SUBSIDIES

compare types of trade restrictions, such as tariffs, quotas, and export subsidies, and their economic implications

Trade restrictions (or trade protection) are government policies that limit the ability of domestic households and firms to trade freely with other countries. Examples of trade restrictions include tariffs, import quotas, voluntary export restraints (VER), subsidies, embargoes, and domestic content requirements. Tariffs are taxes that a government levies on imported goods. Quotas restrict the quantity of a good that can be imported into a country, generally for a specified period of time. A voluntary export restraint is similar to a quota but is imposed by the exporting country. An export subsidy is paid by the government to the firm when it exports a unit of a good that is being subsidized. The goal is to promote exports, but it reduces welfare by encouraging production and trade that is inconsistent with comparative advantage.
Domestic content provisions stipulate that some percentage of the value added or
components used in production should be of domestic origin. Trade restrictions are imposed by countries for several reasons, including protecting established domestic industries from foreign competition, protecting new industries from foreign competition until they mature (infant industry argument), protecting and increasing domestic employment, protecting strategic industries for national security reasons, generating revenue from tariffs (especially for developing countries), and retaliation against trade restrictions imposed by other countries.

Capital restrictions are defined as controls placed on foreigners' ability to own domestic assets or domestic residents' ability to own foreign assets. Thus, in contrast with trade restrictions, which limit the openness of goods markets, capital restrictions limit the openness of financial markets and will be addressed later.

## Tariffs

Tariffs are taxes that a government levies on imported goods. The primary objective of tariffs is to protect domestic industries that produce the same or similar goods. They also may aim to reduce a trade deficit. Tariffs reduce the demand for imported goods by increasing their price above the free trade price. The economic impact of a tariff on imports in a small country is illustrated in Exhibit 1. In this context, a small country is not necessarily small in size, population, or GDP. Instead, a small country is one that is a price taker in the world market for a product and cannot influence the world market price. For example, by many measures, Brazil is a large country, but it is a price taker in the world market for cars. A large country, however, is a large importer of the product and can exercise some influence on price in the world market. When a large country imposes a tariff, the exporter reduces the price of the good to retain some of the market share it could lose if it did not lower its price.

This reduction in price alters the terms of trade and represents a redistribution of income from the exporting country to the importing country. So, in theory, it is possible for a large country to increase its welfare by imposing a tariff if (1) its trading partner does not retaliate and (2) the deadweight loss as a result of the tariff (see below) is smaller than the benefit of improving its terms of trade. Global welfare, however, would still experience a net reduction-the large country cannot gain by imposing a tariff unless it imposes an even larger loss on its trading partner.

In Exhibit 1, the world price (free trade price) is $P^{*}$. Under free trade, domestic supply is $Q^{1}$, domestic consumption is $Q^{4}$, and imports are $Q^{1} Q^{4}$. After the imposition of a per-unit tariff $t$, the domestic price increases to $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{t}}$, which is the sum of the world price and the per-unit tariff $t$. At the new domestic price, domestic production increases to $Q^{2}$ and domestic consumption declines to $Q^{3}$, resulting in a reduction in imports to $Q^{2} Q^{3}$.

The welfare effects of the tariff can be summarized as follows:

- Consumers suffer a loss of consumer surplus because of the increase in price. In Exhibit 1, this effect is represented by areas $\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{D}$.
- Local producers gain producer surplus from a higher price for their output. This effect is represented by area A.
- The government gains tariff revenue on imports $Q^{2} Q^{3}$. This effect is represented by area C.

The net welfare effect is the sum of these three effects and is summarized in Exhibit 2. The loss in consumer surplus is greater than the sum of the gain in producer surplus and government revenue and results in a deadweight loss to the country's welfare of B + D.

Exhibit 2: Welfare Effects of an Import Tariff or Quota

|  | Importing Country |
| :--- | :--- |
| Consumer surplus | $-(\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{D})$ |
| Producer surplus | +A |
| Tariff revenue or Quota rents | +C |
| National welfare | - B - D |

Tariffs create deadweight loss because they give rise to inefficiencies on both the consumption and production side. B represents inefficiencies in production. Instead of being able to import goods at the world price $P^{*}$, tariffs encourage inefficient producers whose cost of production is greater than $P^{*}$ to enter (or remain in) the market, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. On the consumption side, tariffs prevent mutually beneficial exchanges from occurring because consumers who were willing to pay more than $P^{*}$ but less than $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{t}}$ are now unable to consume the good.

## EXAMPLE 1

## Analysis of a Tariff

South Africa manufactures 110,000 tons of paper. However, domestic demand for paper is 200,000 tons. The world price for paper is USD5.00 per ton. South Africa will import 90,000 tons of paper from the world market at free trade prices. If the South African government (a small country) decides to impose a tariff of 20 percent on paper imports, the price of imported paper will increase to USD6.00. Domestic production after the imposition of the tariff increases to 130,000 tons, while the quantity demanded declines to 170,000 tons.

1. Calculate the loss in consumer surplus arising from the imposition of the tariff on imported paper.

## Solution:

The loss in consumer surplus $=$ USD $1 \times 170,000+1 / 2 \times$ USD $1 \times 30,000$ $=$ USD185,000. This calculation is represented by areas A + B + C + D in Exhibit 1.
2. Calculate the gain in producer surplus arising from the imposition of the tariff.

## Solution:

Gain in producer surplus $=$ USD $1 \times 110,000+1 / 2 \times($ USD $1 \times 20,000)=$ USD120,000; Area A in Exhibit 1.
3. Calculate the gain in government revenue arising from the imposition of the tariff.

## Solution:

Change in government revenue $=$ USD $1 \times 40,000=$ USD 40,000 ; Area C in
Exhibit 1.
4. Calculate the deadweight loss arising from the imposition of the tariff.

## Solution:

Deadweight loss because of the tariff $=1 / 2 \times$ USD $1 \times 20,000+1 / 2 \times$ USD $1 \times$ $30,000=$ USD 25,000; Areas B + D in Exhibit 1.

## Quotas

A quota restricts the quantity of a good that can be imported into a country, generally for a specified period of time. An import license specifies the quantity that can be imported. For example, the European Union operates a system of annual import quotas for steel producers who are not members of the World Trade Organization. A key difference between tariffs and quotas is that the government is able to collect the revenue generated from a tariff. This effect is uncertain under a quota. With quotas, foreign producers can often raise the price of their goods and earn greater profits than they would without the quota. These profits are called quota rents. In Exhibit 1, if the quota is $Q^{2} Q^{3}$, the equivalent tariff that will restrict imports to $Q^{2} Q^{3}$ is $t$ and the domestic price after the quota is $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{t}}$. This is the same as the domestic price after the tariff $t$ was imposed. Area C, however, is now the quota rent or profits that are likely to be captured by the foreign producer rather than tariff revenue that is captured by the domestic government. If the foreign producer or foreign government captures the
quota rent, C, then the welfare loss to the importing country, represented by areas $\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{D}+\mathrm{C}$ in Exhibit 1, under a quota is greater than under the equivalent tariff. If the government of the country that imposes the quota can capture the quota rents by auctioning the import licenses for a fee, then the welfare loss under the quota is similar to that of a tariff, represented by areas B + D.

A VER is a trade barrier under which the exporting country agrees to limit its exports of the good to its trading partners to a specific number of units. The main difference between an import quota and a VER is that the former is imposed by the importer, whereas the latter is imposed by the exporter. The VER allows the quota rent resulting from the decrease in trade to be captured by the exporter (or exporting country), whereas in the case of an import quota, there is ambiguity regarding who captures the quota rents. Hence, a VER results in welfare loss in the importing country. For example, in 1981, the Japanese government imposed VERs on automobile exports to the United States.

## Export Subsidies

An export subsidy is a payment by the government to a firm for each unit of a good that is exported. Its goal is to stimulate exports. But it interferes with the functioning of the free market and may distort trade away from comparative advantage. Hence, it reduces welfare. Countervailing duties are duties that are levied by the importing country against subsidized exports entering the country. As an example, agricultural subsidies in developed countries, notably the EU, have been a contentious issue in trade negotiations with emerging market countries and developed market countries that are agricultural exporters, such as New Zealand and Australia.

In the case of an export subsidy, the exporter has the incentive to shift sales from the domestic to the export market because it receives the international price plus the per-unit subsidy for each unit of the good exported. This scenario raises the price in the domestic market by the amount of the subsidy in the small country case (price before subsidy plus subsidy). In the large country case, the world price declines as the large country increases exports. The net welfare effect is negative in both the large and small country cases, with a larger decline in the large country case. In the large country case, the decline in world prices implies that a part of the subsidy is transferred to the foreign country, unlike in the small country case.

Exhibit 3 summarizes some of these effects.

## EXAMPLE 2

## Analysis of Trade Restrictions

Thailand, a small country, has to decide whether to impose a tariff or a quota on the import of computers. You are considering investing in a local firm that is a major importer of computers.

1. What will be the impact of a tariff on prices, quantity produced, and quantity imported in Thailand (the importing country)?

## Solution:

A tariff imposed by a small country, such as Thailand, raises the price of computers in the importing country, reduces the quantity imported, and increases domestic production.
2. If Thailand imposes a tariff, what will the impact be on prices in the exporting country?

## Solution:

A tariff imposed by a small country would not change the price of computers in the exporting country.
3. How would a tariff affect consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government revenue in Thailand?

## Solution:

When a small country imposes a tariff, it reduces consumer surplus, increases producer surplus, and increases government revenue in that country.
4. Explain whether the net welfare effect of a tariff is the same as that of a quota.

## Solution:

The quota can lead to a greater welfare loss than a tariff if the quota rents are captured by the foreign government or foreign firms.
5. Which policy, a tariff or a quota, would be most beneficial to the local importer in which you may invest and why?

## Solution:

A tariff will hurt importers because it will reduce their share of the computer market in Thailand. The impact of a quota depends on whether or not the importers can capture a share of the quota rents. Assuming importers can capture at least part of the rents, they will be better off with a quota.
6. If Thailand were to negotiate a VER with the countries from which it imports computers, would this be better or worse than an import quota for the local importing firm in which you may invest? Why?

## Solution:

The VER would not be better for the local importer than the import quota and would most likely be worse. Under the VER, all of the quota rents will be captured by the exporting countries whereas with an import quota at least part of the quota rents may be captured by local importers.

It is important to understand existing trade policies and the potential for policy changes that may affect return on investment. Changes in the government's trade policy can affect the pattern and value of trade and may result in changes in industry structure. These changes may have important implications for firm profitability and growth because they can affect the goods a firm can import or export; change demand for its products; affect its pricing policies; and create delays through increased paperwork, procurement of licenses, approvals, and so on. For example, changes in import policies that affect the ability of a firm to import vital inputs for production may increase the cost of production and reduce firm profitability.

## TRADING BLOCS AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION

explain motivations for and advantages of trading blocs, common markets, and economic unions

There has been a proliferation of trading blocs or regional trading agreements (RTA) in recent years. Important examples of regional integration include the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the European Union (EU). A regional trading bloc is a group of countries that have signed an agreement to reduce and progressively eliminate barriers to trade and movement of factors of production among the members of the bloc. It may or may not have common trade barriers against countries that are not members of the bloc.
