B. $0.05303-0.05302$.
C. $0.053025-0.053025$.

## Solution:

A is correct. An MXN/USD quote is the amount of Mexican pesos the dealer is bidding (offering) to buy (sell) USD1. The dealer's bid to buy USD1 at MXN18.8580 is equivalent to the dealer paying MXN18.8580 to buy USD1. Dividing both terms by 18.8580 means the dealer is paying (i.e., selling) MXN1 to buy USD0.05303. This is the offer in USD/MXN terms: The dealer offers to sell MXN1 at a price of USD0.05303. In USD/MXN terms, the dealer's bid for MXN1 is 0.05302, calculated by inverting the offer of 18.8600 in MXN/USD terms ( $1 / 18.8600=0.05302$ ). Note that in any bid/offer quote, no matter which base or price currencies are used, the bid is always lower than the offer.

## EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES: IDEALS AND HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

describe exchange rate regimes and explain the effects of exchange rates on countries' international trade and capital flows

FX rates affect international capital flows and trading relationships. These rate movements are based on the relative economic stability and efficiency of the trading countries involved. As a result, countries having higher or lower economic or trading volatility use different exchange regimes to address their economic objectives. This lesson describes these factors and concludes with an example from Malaysia.

Highly volatile exchange rates create uncertainty that undermines the efficiency of real economic activity and the financial transactions required to facilitate that activity. Exchange rate volatility also has a direct impact on investment decisions because it is a key component of the risk inherent in foreign (i.e., foreign-currency-denominated) assets. Exchange rate volatility is also a critical factor in selecting hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures.

The amount of FX rate volatility will depend, at least in part, on the institutional and policy arrangements associated with trade in any given currency. Virtually every exchange rate is managed to some degree by central banks. The policy framework that each central bank adopts is called an exchange rate regime. Although there are many potential variations, these regimes fall into a few general categories. Before describing each of these types, we consider the possibility of an ideal regime and provide some historical perspective on the evolution of currency arrangements.

## The Ideal Currency Regime

The ideal currency regime would have three properties. First, the exchange rate between any two currencies would be credibly fixed. This would eliminate currency-related uncertainty with respect to the prices of goods and services as well as real and financial assets. Second, all currencies would be fully convertible (i.e., currencies could be freely exchanged for any purpose and in any amount). This condition ensures the
unrestricted flow of capital. Third, each country would be able to undertake fully independent monetary policy in pursuit of domestic objectives, such as growth and inflation targets.

Unfortunately, these three conditions are not consistent. If the first two conditions were satisfied-credibly fixed exchange rates and full convertibility-then there would really be only one currency in the world. Converting from one national currency to another would have no more significance (indeed less) than deciding whether to carry coins or paper currency in your wallet. Any attempt to influence interest rates, asset prices, or inflation by adjusting the supply of one currency versus another would be futile. Thus, independent monetary policy is not possible if exchange rates are credibly fixed and currencies are fully convertible. There can be no ideal currency regime.

The impact of the currency regime on a country's ability to exercise independent monetary policy is a recurring theme in open-economy macroeconomics. It will be covered in more detail in other readings; however, it is worth emphasizing the basic point by considering what would happen in an idealized world of perfect capital mobility. If the exchange rate were credibly fixed, then any attempt to decrease default-free interest rates in one country below those in another-that is, to undertake independent, expansionary monetary policy-would result in a potentially unlimited outflow of capital because funds would seek the higher return. The central bank would be forced to sell foreign currency and buy domestic currency to maintain the fixed exchange rate. The loss of reserves and reduction in the domestic money supply would put upward pressure on domestic interest rates until rates were forced back to equality, negating the initial expansionary policy. Similarly, a contractionary monetary policy (higher interest rates) would be thwarted by an inflow of capital.

The situation is quite different, however, with a floating exchange rate. A decrease in the domestic interest rate would make the domestic currency less attractive. The resulting depreciation of the domestic currency would shift demand toward domestically produced goods (i.e., exports rise and imports fall), reinforcing the expansionary impact of the initial decline in the interest rate. Similarly, a contractionary increase in the interest rate would be reinforced by appreciation of the domestic currency.

In practice, of course, capital is not perfectly mobile, and the impact on monetary policy is not so stark. The fact remains, however, that fixed exchange rates limit the scope for independent monetary policy and that national monetary policy regains potency and independence, at least to some degree, if the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate or restrictions are placed on convertibility. In general, the more freely the exchange rate is allowed to float and the more tightly convertibility is controlled, the more effective the central bank can be in addressing domestic macroeconomic objectives. The downside, of course, is the potential distortion of economic activity caused by exchange rate risk and inefficient allocation of financial capital.

## Historical Perspective on Currency Regimes

How currencies exchange for one another has evolved over the centuries. At any point in time, different exchange rate systems may coexist; still, the world economy tends to have one dominant system. Throughout most of the 19th century and the early 20th century until the start of World War I, the US dollar and the British pound sterling operated on the "classical gold standard." The price of each currency was fixed in terms of gold. Gold was the numeraire (the unit in terms of which other goods, services, and assets were priced) for each currency; therefore, it was indirectly the numeraire for all other prices in the economy. Many countries (e.g., the colonies of the United Kingdom) fixed their currencies relative to sterling and were therefore implicitly also operating on the classical gold standard.

The classical gold standard operated by what is called the price-specie-flow mechanism. This mechanism operated through the impact of trade imbalances on capital flows, namely gold. As countries experienced a trade surplus, they accumulated gold as payment, their domestic money supply expanded by the amount dictated by the fixed parity, prices rose, and exports fell. Similarly, when a country ran a trade deficit, there was an automatic outflow of gold, a contraction of the domestic money supply, and a fall in prices leading to increased exports.

In this system, national currencies were backed by gold. A country could print only as much money as its gold reserve allowed. The system was limited by the amount of gold, but it was self-adjusting and inspired confidence. With a fixed stock of gold, the price-specie-flow mechanism would work well. Still, new gold discoveries as well as more efficient methods of refining gold would enable a country to increase its gold reserves and increase its money supply apart from the effect of trade flows. In general, however, trade flows drove changes in national money supplies.

Economic historians disagree about the effect of the classical gold standard on overall macroeconomic stability. Was it destabilizing? On the one hand, monetary policy was tied to trade flows, so a country could not engage in expansionary policies when there was a downturn in the non-traded sector. On the other hand, tying monetary policy to trade flows kept inflation in check.

During the 1930s, the use of gold as a clearing device for settlement of trade imbalances, combined with increasing protectionism on the part of economies struggling with depression as well as episodes of deflation and hyperinflation, created a chaotic environment for world trade. As a consequence of these factors, world trade dropped by more than 50 percent and the gold standard was abandoned.

In the latter stages of World War II, a new system of fixed exchange rates with periodic realignments was devised by John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, representing the UK and US Treasuries, respectively. The Bretton Woods system, named after the town where it was negotiated, was adopted by 44 countries in 1944. From the end of the war until the collapse of the system in the early 1970s, the United States, Japan, and most of the industrial countries of Europe maintained a system of fixed parities for exchange rates between currencies. When the parities were significantly and persistently out of line with the balancing of supply and demand, there would be a realignment of currencies with some appreciating in value and others depreciating in value. These periodic realignments were viewed as a part of standard monetary policy.

By 1973, with chronic inflation taking hold throughout the world, most nations abandoned the Bretton Woods system in favor of a flexible exchange rate system under what are known as the Smithsonian Agreements. Milton Friedman had called for such a system as far back as the 1950s. His argument was that the fixed parity system with periodic realignments would become unsustainable. When the inevitable realignments were imminent, large speculative profit opportunities would appear. Speculators would force the hand of monetary policy authorities, and their actions would distort the data needed to ascertain appropriate trade-related parities. It is better, he argued, to let the market, rather than central bank governors and treasury ministers, determine the exchange rate.

After 1973, most of the industrial world changed to a system of flexible exchange rates. The original thinking was that the forces that caused exchange rate chaos in the 1930s-poor domestic monetary policy and trade barriers-would not be present in a flexible exchange rate regime, and therefore exchange rates would move in response to the exchange of goods and services among countries. However, exchange rates moved around much more than anyone expected. Academic economists and financial analysts alike soon realized that the high degree of exchange rate volatility was the manifestation of a highly liquid, forward-looking asset market. Investment-driven FX transactions-for both long-term investment and short-term speculation-mattered much more in setting the spot exchange rate than anyone had previously imagined.

There are costs, of course, to a high degree of exchange rate volatility. These include difficulty planning without hedging exchange rate risks-a form of insurance cost, domestic price fluctuations, uncertain costs of raw materials, and short-term interruptions in financing transactions. For these reasons, in 1979 the European Economic Community opted for a system of limited flexibility, the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).

Initially, the system called for European currency values to fluctuate within a narrow band called "the snake," but this system did not last long. The end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany created conditions ripe for speculative attack. In the early 1990s, the United Kingdom was in a recession and the government's monetary policy leaned toward low interest rates to stimulate economic recovery. Germany was issuing large amounts of debt to pay for reunification, and the German central bank (the Deutsche Bundesbank) opted for high interest rates to ensure price stability. Capital began to flow from sterling to Deutsche marks to obtain the higher interest rate. The Bank of England tried to lean against these flows and maintain the exchange rate within the ERM, but eventually it began to run out of marks to sell. Because it was almost certain that devaluation would be required, holders of sterling rushed to purchase marks at the old rate, and the speculative attack forced the United Kingdom out of the ERM in September 1992, only two years after it finally had joined the system.

Despite these difficulties, 1999 saw the creation of a common currency for most Western European countries, without Switzerland or the United Kingdom, called the euro. The hope was that the common currency would increase transparency of prices across borders in Europe, enhance market competition, and facilitate more efficient allocation of resources. The drawback, of course, is that each member country lost the ability to manage its exchange rate and therefore to engage in independent monetary policy.

1. An exchange rate:
A. is most commonly quoted in real terms.
B. is the price of one currency in terms of another.
C. between two currencies ensures that they are fully convertible.

## Solution:

B is correct. The exchange rate is the number of units of the price currency that one unit of the base currency will buy. Equivalently, it is the number of units of the price currency required to buy one unit of the base currency.
2. Which of the following is not a condition of an ideal currency regime?
A. Fully convertible currencies
B. Fully independent monetary policy
C. Independently floating exchange rates

## Solution:

C is correct. An ideal currency regime would have credibly fixed exchange rates among all currencies. This would eliminate currency-related uncertainty with respect to the prices of goods and services as well as real and financial assets.

## A Taxonomy of Currency Regimes

Although the pros and cons of fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes continue to be debated, regimes have been adopted that lie somewhere between these polar cases. In some cases, the driving force is the lack of credibility with respect to sound monetary policy. An economy with a history of hyperinflation may be forced to adopt a form of fixed-rate regime because its promise to maintain a sound currency with a floating rate regime would not be credible. This has been a persistent issue in Latin America. In other cases, the driving force is as much political as it is economic. The decision to create the euro was strongly influenced by the desire to enhance political union within the European Community, whose members had been at war with each other twice in the 20th century.

As of April 2008, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified exchange rate regimes into the eight categories shown in Exhibit 6.

Exhibit 6: Exchange Rate Regimes for Selected Economies as of 30 April 2008

| Currency Anchor |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Type of Regime | US Dollar | Euro | Basket/None |
| No separate legal tender |  |  |  |
| Dollarized | Ecuador, El Salvador, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Panama, Timor-Leste, Zimbabwe | Kosovo, Montenegro, San Marino | Kiribati, Tuvalu |
| Monetary union |  | EMU: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovak Rep., Slovenia, Spain |  |
| Currency board | Djibouti, Hong Kong SAR, Antigua and Barbuda | Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria | Brunei Darussalam |
| Fixed parity | Aruba, The Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Curaçao and Saint Maarten, Eritrea, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Sudan, Turkmenistan, UAE, Venezuela | Cabo Verde, Comoros, Denmark, São Tomé and Príncipe WAEMU: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo CEMAC: Cameroon, Central African Rep., Chad, Rep. of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon | Fiji, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Samoa, Bhutan, Lesotho, Namibia, Nepal, Swaziland |
| Target zone |  | Slovak Republic | Syria |
| Crawling peg | Nicaragua |  | Botswana |
| Crawling band | Honduras, Jamaica | Croatia | China, Ethiopia, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Argentina, Belarus, Haiti, Switzerland, Tunisia |


| Type of Regime | Currency Anchor |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | US Dollar | Euro | Basket/None |
| Managed float | Cambodia, Liberia |  | Algeria, Iran, Syria, The Gambia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Rwanda, Czech Rep., Costa Rica, Malaysia, Mauritania Pakistan, Russia, Sudan, Vanuatu |
| Independent float | Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom, Somalia, United States | Albania, Brazil, Colombia, Georgia, Ghana, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Korea, Moldova, New Zealand, Paraguay, Peru | Philippines, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda |

Global financial markets are too complex and diverse to be fully captured by this (or any other) classification system. A government's control over the domestic currency's exchange rate will depend on many factors; for example, the degree of capital controls used to prevent the free flow of funds in and out of the economy. Also, even under an "independent float" regime, monetary authorities will occasionally intervene in FX markets to influence the value of their domestic currency. Additionally, the specifics of exchange rate policy implementation are subject to change.

This means that the classifications in Exhibit 6 are somewhat arbitrary and subject to interpretation, and they change over time. The important point is that the prices and flows in FX markets will, to varying degrees, reflect the legal and regulatory framework imposed by governments, not just "pure" market forces. Governments have a variety of motives and tools to attempt to manage exchange rates. The taxonomy in Exhibit 6 can be used to help understand the main distinctions among currency regimes and the rationales for adopting them, but the specific definitions should not be interpreted too rigidly. Instead, the focus should be on the diversity of FX markets globally as well as the implications of these various currency regimes for market pricing.

## Arrangements with No Separate Legal Tender

The IMF identifies two types of arrangements for countries that do not have their own legal tender. In the first, known as dollarization, the country uses the currency of another nation as its medium of exchange and unit of account. In the second, the country participates in a monetary union whose members share the same legal tender. In either case, the country gives up the ability to conduct its own monetary policy.

In principle, a country could adopt any currency as its medium of exchange and unit of account, but the main reserve currency, the US dollar, is an obvious choicehence the name dollarization. Many countries are dollarized: East Timor, El Salvador, Ecuador, and Panama, for example. By adopting another country's currency as legal tender, a dollarized country inherits that country's currency credibility, but not its creditworthiness. For example, although local banks may borrow, lend, and accept deposits in US dollars, they are not members of the US Federal Reserve System, nor are they backed by deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Thus, interest rates on US dollars in a dollarized economy need not be, and generally are not, the same as on dollar deposits in the United States.

Dollarization imposes fiscal discipline by eliminating the possibility that the central bank will be induced to monetize government debt (i.e., to persistently purchase government debt with newly created local currency). For countries with a history of fiscal excess or a lack of monetary discipline, dollarizing the economy can facilitate growth of international trade and capital flows if it creates an expectation of economic and financial stability. In the process, however, it removes another potential source of stabilization-domestic monetary policy.

The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is the most prominent example of the second type of arrangement lacking separate legal tender. Each EMU member country uses the euro as its currency. Although member countries cannot have their own monetary policies, they jointly determine monetary policy through their representation at the European Central Bank (ECB). As with dollarization, a monetary union confers currency credibility on members with a history of fiscal excess or a lack of monetary discipline. As shown by the 2010 EMU sovereign debt crisis, however, a monetary union alone cannot confer creditworthiness.

## Currency Board System

The IMF defines a currency board system (CBS) as follows:

> A monetary regime based on an explicit legislative commitment to exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate, combined with restrictions on the issuing authority to ensure fulfillment of its legal obligation. This implies that domestic currency will be issued only against foreign exchange and it remains fully backed by foreign assets.

Hong Kong SAR has the leading example of a long-standing (since 1983) currency board. US dollar reserves are held to cover, at the fixed parity, the entire monetary base-essentially bank reserves plus all Hong Kong dollar notes and coins in circulation. Note that Hong Kong-dollar-denominated bank deposits are not fully collateralized by US dollar reserves; to do so would mean that banks could not lend against their deposits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) does not function as a traditional central bank under this system because the obligation to maintain 100 percent foreign currency reserves against the monetary base prevents it from acting as a lender-of-last-resort for troubled financial institutions. It can, however, provide short-term liquidity by lending against foreign currency collateral.

A CBS works much like the classical gold standard in that expansion and contraction of the monetary base are directly linked to trade and capital flows. As with the gold standard, a CBS works best if domestic prices and wages are very flexible, non-traded sectors of the domestic economy are relatively small, and the global supply of the reserve asset grows at a slow, steady rate consistent with long-run real growth with stable prices. The first two of these conditions are satisfied in Hong Kong SAR. Until and unless Hong Kong SAR selects a new reserve asset, however, the third condition depends on US monetary policy.

In practice, the HKD exhibits modest fluctuations around the official parity of HKD/USD $=7.80$ because the HKMA buys (sells) US dollars at a pre-announced level slightly below (above) the parity. Persistent flows on one side of this convertibility zone or the other result in interest rate adjustments rather than exchange rate adjustments. Inside the zone, however, the exchange rate is determined by the market and the HKMA is free to conduct limited monetary operations aimed at dampening transitory interest rate movements.

One of the advantages of a CBS as opposed to dollarization is that the monetary authority can earn a profit by paying little or no interest on its liability-the monetary base-and can earn a market rate on its asset-the foreign currency reserves. This profit is called seigniorage. Under dollarization, the seigniorage goes to the monetary authority whose currency is used.

## Fixed Parity

A simple fixed-rate system differs from a CBS in two important respects. First, there is no legislative commitment to maintaining the specified parity. Thus, market participants know that the country may choose to adjust or abandon the parity rather than endure other, potentially more painful, adjustments. Second, the target level of FX reserves is discretionary; it bears no particular relationship to domestic monetary
aggregates. Thus, although monetary independence is ultimately limited as long as the exchange peg is maintained, the central bank can carry out traditional functions, such as serving as lender of last resort.

In the conventional fixed-rate system, the exchange rate may be pegged to a single currency-for example, the US dollar-or to a basket index of the currencies of major trading partners. There is a band of up to $\pm 1$ percent around the parity level within which private flows are allowed to determine the exchange rate. The monetary authority stands ready to spend its foreign currency reserves, or buy foreign currency, to maintain the rate within these bands.

The credibility of the fixed parity depends on the country's willingness and ability to offset imbalances in private sector demand for its currency. Both excess and deficient private demand for the currency can exert pressure to adjust or abandon the parity. Excess private demand for the domestic currency implies a rapidly growing stock of FX reserves, expansion of the domestic money supply, and potentially accelerating inflation. Deficient demand for the currency depletes FX reserves and exerts deflationary pressure on the economy. If market participants believe the FX reserves are insufficient to sustain the parity, then that belief may be self-fulfilling because the resulting speculative attack will drain reserves and may force an immediate devaluation. Thus, the level of reserves required to maintain credibility is a key issue for a simple fixed exchange rate regime.

## Target Zone

A target zone regime has a fixed parity with fixed horizontal intervention bands that are somewhat wider-up to $\pm 2$ percent around the parity-than in the simple fixed parity regime. The wider bands provide the monetary authority with greater scope for discretionary policy.

## Active and Passive Crawling Pegs

Crawling pegs for the exchange rate-usually against a single currency, such as the US dollar-were common in the 1980s in Latin America, particularly Brazil, during the high inflation periods. To prevent a run on the US dollar reserves, the exchange rate was adjusted frequently (weekly or daily) to keep pace with the inflation rate. Such a system was called a passive crawl. An adaptation used in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay was the active crawl: The exchange rate was pre-announced for the coming weeks with changes taking place in small steps. The aim of the active crawl was to manipulate expectations of inflation. Because the domestic prices of many goods were directly tied to import prices, announced changes in the exchange rate would effectively signal future changes in the inflation rate of these goods.

## Fixed Parity with Crawling Bands

A country can also have a fixed central parity with crawling bands. Initially, a country may fix its rates to a foreign currency to anchor expectations about future inflation, but then the country may gradually permit increasing flexibility in the form of a pre-announced widening band around the central parity. Such a system has the desirable property of allowing a gradual exit strategy from the fixed parity. A country might want to introduce greater flexibility and greater scope for monetary policy, but it may not yet have the credibility or financial infrastructure for full flexibility. In this case, it can maintain a fixed parity with slowly widening bands.

## Managed Float

A country may simply follow an exchange rate policy based on either internal or external policy targets-intervening or not to achieve trade balance, price stability, or employment objectives. Such a policy, often called dirty floating, invites trading
partners to respond likewise with their exchange rate policy and potentially decreases stability in FX markets as a whole. The exchange rate target, in terms of either a level or a rate of change, typically is not explicit.

## Independently Floating Rates

In this case, the exchange rate is left to market determination and the monetary authority is able to exercise independent monetary policy aimed at achieving such objectives as price stability and full employment. The central bank also has latitude to act as a lender of last resort to troubled financial institutions, if necessary.

It should be clear from recent experience that the concepts of float, managed float, crawl, and target zone are not hard and fast rules. Central banks do occasionally engage, implicitly or explicitly, in regime switches-even in countries nominally following an independently floating exchange rate regime. For example, when the US dollar appreciated in the mid-1980s with record US trade deficits, then-US Treasury Secretary James Baker engineered the Plaza Accord, in which Japan and Germany implemented an appreciation of their currencies against the US dollar. (The Plaza Accord is so named because it was negotiated at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.) This 1985 policy agreement involved a combination of fiscal and monetary policy measures by the countries involved as well as direct intervention in FX markets. The Plaza Accord was a clear departure from a pure independently floating exchange rate system.

There are more recent examples of government intervention in FX markets. In September 2000, the ECB, the Federal Reserve Board, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada engaged in "concerted" intervention to support the value of the euro, a "freely floating" currency that was then under pressure within FX markets. (This intervention was described as "concerted" because it was pre-arranged and coordinated among the central banks involved.) During 2010, many countries engaged in unilateral intervention to prevent the rapid appreciation of their currencies against the US dollar. Several of these countries also employed various fiscal and regulatory measures (e.g., taxes on capital inflows) to further affect exchange rate movements.

The important point to draw from this discussion is that exchange rates not only reflect private sector market forces but also will be influenced, to varying degrees, by the legal and regulatory framework (currency regimes) within which FX markets operate. Moreover, they will occasionally be influenced by government policies (fiscal, monetary, and intervention) intended to manage exchange rates. All of these can vary widely among countries and are subject to change with time.

Nonetheless, the most widely traded currencies in FX markets (the US dollar, yen, euro, UK pound, Swiss franc, and the Canadian and Australian dollars) are typically considered to be free floating, although subject to relatively infrequent intervention.

## EXAMPLE 4

## Exchange Rate Regimes

An investment adviser in Los Angeles, United States, is meeting with a client who wishes to diversify her portfolio by including more international investments. To evaluate the suitability of international diversification for the client, the adviser attempts to explain some of the characteristics of FX markets. The adviser points out that exchange rate regimes affect the performance of domestic economies as well as the amount of FX risk posed by international investments.

The client and her adviser discuss potential investments in Hong Kong SAR, Panama, and Canada. The adviser notes that the currency regimes of Hong Kong SAR, Panama, and Canada are a currency board, dollarization, and a free float, respectively. The adviser tells his client that these regimes imply different degrees of FX risk for her portfolio.

The discussion between the investment adviser and his client then turns to potential investments in other markets with different currency regimes. The adviser notes that some markets are subject to fixed parity regimes against the US dollar. The client asks whether a fixed parity regime would imply less foreign currency risk for her portfolio than would a currency board. The adviser replies: "Yes, a fixed parity regime means a constant exchange rate and is more credible than a currency board."

The adviser goes on to explain that in some markets, exchange rates are allowed to vary, although with different degrees of FX market intervention to limit exchange rate volatility. Citing examples, he notes that mainland China has a crawling peg regime with reference to the US dollar, but the average daily percentage changes in the mainland China/US exchange rate are very small compared with the average daily volatility for a freely floating currency. The adviser also indicates that Denmark has a target zone regime with reference to the euro, and South Korea usually follows a freely floating currency regime but sometimes switches to a managed float regime. The currencies of mainland China, Denmark, and South Korea are the yuan renminbi (CNY), krone (DKK), and won (KRW), respectively.

1. Based solely on the exchange rate risk the client would face, what is the correct ranking (from most to least risky) of the following investment locations?
A. Panama, Canada, Hong Kong SAR
B. Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Panama
C. Hong Kong SAR, Panama, Canada

Solution:
B is correct. The CAD/USD exchange rate is a floating exchange rate, and Canadian investments would therefore carry exchange rate risk for a USbased investor. Although Hong Kong SAR follows a currency board system, the HKD/USD exchange rate nonetheless does display some variation, albeit much less than in a floating exchange rate regime. In contrast, Panama has a dollarized economy (i.e., it uses the US dollar as the domestic currency); therefore, there is no FX risk for a US investor.
2. Based solely on their FX regimes, which investment location is least likely to import inflation or deflation from the United States?
A. Canada
B. Panama
C. Hong Kong SAR

Solution:
A is correct. The Canadian dollar floats independently against the US dollar leaving the Bank of Canada able to adjust monetary policy to maintain price stability. Neither Hong Kong SAR (currency board) nor Panama (dollarized) can exercise independent monetary policy to buffer its economy from the inflationary or deflationary consequences of US monetary policy.
3. The adviser's reply about fixed parity regimes is incorrect with regard to:
A. credibility.
B. a constant exchange rate.
C. both a constant exchange rate and credibility.

## Solution:

C is correct. A fixed exchange rate regime does not mean that the exchange rate is rigidly fixed at a constant level. In practice, both a fixed-rate regime and a currency board allow the exchange rate to vary within a band around the stated parity level. Thus, both regimes involve at least a modest amount of exchange rate risk. The fixed parity regime exposes the investor to the additional risk that the parity may not be maintained. In a fixed parity regime, the level of foreign currency reserves is discretionary and typically only a small fraction of the domestic money supply. With no legal obligation to maintain the parity, the monetary authority may adjust the parity (devalue or revalue its currency) or allow its currency to float if doing so is deemed to be less painful than other adjustment mechanisms (e.g., fiscal restraint). In contrast, a currency board entails a legal commitment to maintain the parity and to fully back the domestic currency with reserve currency assets. Hence, there is little risk that the parity will be abandoned.
4. Based on the adviser's categorization of mainland China's currency regime, if the US dollar is depreciating against the South Korean won, then it is most likely correct that the Chinese yuan is:
A. fixed against the South Korean won.
B. appreciating against the South Korean won.
C. depreciating against the South Korean won.

## Solution:

C is correct. If the Chinese yuan is subject to a crawling peg with very small daily adjustments versus the US dollar, and the US dollar is depreciating against the South Korean won, then the Chinese yuan mostlikely would be depreciating against the South Korean won as well. In fact, this was an important issue in FX markets through the latter part of 2010: As the US dollar depreciated against most Asian currencies (and less so against the Chinese yuan), many Asian countries felt that they were losing their competitive export advantage because the Chinese yuan was so closely tied to the US dollar. This led many Asian countries to intervene in FX markets against the strength of their domestic currencies to avoid losing an export pricing advantage against the Chinese mainland.
5. Based on the adviser's categorization of Denmark's currency regime, it would be most correct to infer that the:
A. krone is allowed to float against the euro within fixed bands.
B. Danish central bank will intervene if the exchange rate strays from its target level.
C. target zone will be adjusted periodically to manage inflation expectations.

## Solution:

A is correct. A target zone means that the exchange rate between the euro and Danish krone (DKK) will be allowed to vary within a fixed band (as of 2010, the target zone for the DKK/EUR is a $\pm 2.5$ percent band). This does
not mean that the DKK/EUR rate is fixed at a certain level (B is incorrect) or that the target zone will vary to manage inflation expectations (this is a description of a crawling peg, which makes C incorrect).
6. Based on the adviser's categorization of South Korea's currency policy, it would be most correct to infer that the Korean:
A. central bank is engineering a gradual exit from a fixed-rate regime.
B. government is attempting to peg the exchange rate within a predefined zone.
C. won is allowed to float, but with occasional intervention by the Korean central bank.
Solution:
C is correct. Similar to the monetary authorities responsible for many of the world's major currencies, the South Korean policy typically involves letting market forces determine the exchange rate (an independent floating rate regime). But this approach does not mean that market forces are the sole determinant of the won exchange rate. As with most governments, the South Korean policy is to intervene in FX markets when movements in the exchange rate are viewed as undesirable (a managed float). For example, during the latter part of 2010, South Korea and many other countries intervened in FX markets to moderate the appreciation of their currencies against the US dollar. Answer A describes a fixed parity with a crawling bands regime, and $B$ describes a target zone regime: Both answers are incorrect.

1. In practice, both a fixed parity regime and a target zone regime allow the exchange rate to float within a band around the parity level. The most likely rationale for the band is that the band allows the monetary authority to:
A. be less active in the currency market.
B. earn a spread on its currency transactions.
C. exercise more discretion in monetary policy.

## Solution:

C is correct. Fixed exchange rates impose severe limitations on the exercise of independent monetary policy. With a rigidly fixed exchange rate, domestic interest rates, monetary aggregates (e.g., money supply), and credit conditions are dictated by the requirement to buy/sell the currency at the rigid parity. Even a narrow band around the parity level allows the monetary authority to exercise some discretionary control over these conditions. In general, the wider the band, the more independent control the monetary authority can exercise.
2. A fixed exchange rate regime in which the monetary authority is legally required to hold FX reserves backing 100 percent of its domestic currency issuance is best described as:
A. dollarization.
B. a currency board.
C. a monetary union.

Solution:
B is correct. With a currency board, the monetary authority is legally required to exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate. It cannot issue domestic currency without receiving foreign currency in exchange, and it must hold that foreign currency as a 100 percent reserve against the domestic currency issued. Thus, the country's monetary base (bank reserves plus notes and coins in circulation) is fully backed by FX reserves.

## Exchange Rates and the Trade Balance: Introduction

Just as a family that spends more than it earns must borrow or sell assets to finance the excess, a country that imports more goods and services than it exports must either borrow from or sell assets to foreign entities to finance the trade deficit. Conversely, a country that exports more goods and services than it imports must invest the excess either by lending to foreigners or by buying assets from foreigners. Thus, a trade deficit (surplus) must be exactly matched by an offsetting capital account surplus (deficit). This implies that any factor that affects the trade balance must have an equal and opposite impact on the capital account, and vice versa. To put this differently, the impact of exchange rates and other factors on the trade balance must be mirrored by their impact on capital flows: They cannot affect one without affecting the other.

Using a fundamental identity from macroeconomics, the relationship between the trade balance and expenditure/saving decisions can be expressed as follows:

$$
X-M=(S-I)+(T-G),
$$

where $X$ represents exports, $M$ is imports, $S$ is private savings, $I$ is investment in plant and equipment, $T$ is taxes net of transfers, and $G$ is government expenditure. From this relationship, we can see that a trade surplus $(X>M)$ must be reflected in a fiscal surplus ( $T>G$ ), an excess of private saving over investment ( $S>I$ ), or both. Because a fiscal surplus can be viewed as government saving, we can summarize this relationship more simply by saying that a trade surplus means the country saves more than enough to fund its investment ( $I$ ) in plant and equipment. The excess saving is used to accumulate financial claims on the rest of the world. Conversely, a trade deficit means the country does not save enough to fund its investment spending $(I)$ and must reduce its net financial claims on the rest of the world.

Although this identity provides a key link between real expenditure and saving decisions and the aggregate flow of financial assets into or out of a country, it does not tell us what type of financial assets will be exchanged or in what currency they will be denominated. All that can be said is that asset prices and exchange rates at home and abroad must adjust so that all financial assets are willingly held by investors.

If investors anticipate a significant change in an exchange rate, they will try to sell the currency that is expected to depreciate and buy the currency that is expected to appreciate. This implies an incipient (i.e., potential) flow of capital from one country to the other, which must either be accompanied by a simultaneous shift in the trade balance or be discouraged by changes in asset prices and exchange rates. Because expenditure/saving decisions and prices of goods change much more slowly than financial investment decisions and asset prices, most of the adjustment usually occurs within the financial markets. That is, asset prices and exchange rates adjust so that the potential flow of financial capital is mitigated and actual capital flows remain consistent with trade flows. In a fixed exchange rate regime, the central bank offsets the private capital flows in the process of maintaining the exchange rate peg and the adjustment occurs in other asset prices, typically interest rates, until and unless the central bank
is forced to allow the exchange rate to adjust. In a floating exchange rate regime, the main adjustment is often a rapid change in the exchange rate that dampens an investor's conviction that further movement will be forthcoming. Thus, capital flows-potential and actual-are the primary determinant of exchange rate movements in the short to intermediate term. Trade flows become increasingly important in the long term as expenditure and saving decisions as well as the prices of goods and services adjust.

1. A country with a trade deficit will most likely:
A. have an offsetting capital account surplus.
B. save enough to fund its investment spending.
C. buy assets from foreigners to fund the imbalance.

## Solution:

A is correct. A trade deficit must be exactly matched by an offsetting capital account surplus to fund the deficit. A capital account surplus reflects borrowing from foreigners (an increase in domestic liabilities) and/or selling assets to foreigners (a decrease in domestic assets). A capital account surplus is often referred to as a "capital inflow" because the net effect is foreign investment in the domestic economy.

## CAPITAL RESTRICTIONS

describe common objectives of capital restrictions imposed by governments

Governments restrict inward and outward flow of capital for many reasons. For example, the government may want to meet some objective regarding employment or regional development, or it may have a strategic or defense-related objective. Many countries require approval for foreigners to invest in their country and for citizens to invest abroad. Control over inward investment by foreigners results in restrictions on how much can be invested, and on the type of industries in which capital can be invested. For example, such strategic industries as defense and telecommunications are often subject to ownership restrictions. Outflow restrictions can include restrictions on repatriation of capital, interest, profits, royalty payments, and license fees. Citizens are often limited in their ability to invest abroad, especially in FX-scarce economies, and there can be deadlines for repatriation of income earned from any investments abroad.

Economists consider free movement of financial capital to be beneficial because it allows capital to be invested where it will earn the highest return. Inflows of capital also allow countries to invest in productive capacity at a rate that is higher than could be achieved with domestic savings alone, and it can enable countries to achieve a higher rate of growth. Long-term investments by foreign firms that establish a presence in the local economy can bring in not only much needed capital but also new technology, skills, and advanced production and management practices as well as create spillover benefits for local firms. Investment by foreign firms can create a network of local suppliers if they source some of their components locally. Such suppliers may
