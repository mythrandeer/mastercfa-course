## ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS OF BUSINESSES

compare the organizational forms of businesses

In most market economies, there are three general types of organization, each with distinct purposes, stakeholders, and governing legal frameworks: for-profit organizations, known as businesses or companies; not-for-profit non-governmental organizations, or simply non-profits; and governments.

The focus of this and subsequent modules are businesses, because financial analysts are important participants in the markets for their financial resources. However, non-profits and governments often are investors in businesses, which will be covered in later lessons. Governments as issuers of debt and other securities are covered in modules on fixed income.

## Organizational Forms of Businesses

Business owners choose a legal organizational form that defines how returns, risks, and ownership and operational responsibilities are distributed. There are three general forms common to most jurisdictions.

Exhibit 1: Organizational Forms of Businesses
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_4188d754fc2a687b680fg-01.jpg?height=315&width=1158&top_left_y=1913&top_left_x=635)

The organizational forms of businesses differ by several attributes:

- Legal identity: Whether the business is legally considered a separate entity or person apart from its owners
- Owner-manager relationship: The relationship between the owner(s) of the business and those who manage the business
- Owner liability: The extent to which owners are personally legally liable for actions or debts undertaken by the business
- Taxation: The treatment of business profits or losses for tax purposes
- Access to financing: The ability to raise capital to fund expansion and distribute risks

Every jurisdiction has its own specific versions and variants of organizational forms, including different names for them. We are not attempting to provide an exhaustive treatment of jurisdictional specifics; rather, we provide the general and common attributes that analysts must know to ask the right questions in their own research on specific investment candidates and business cases.

## Sole Trader or Proprietorship

The simplest organizational form is the sole trader or proprietorship, shown in Exhibit 2. In a sole proprietorship, the owner provides the capital needed to start and operate the business and retains full control over management, while participating fully in the firm's financial returns and risks. In some jurisdictions, this form is the default form, requiring no formal legal registration, and is dissolved when the owner ceases business activity or dies.

## Exhibit 2: Sole Trader or Proprietorship

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_4188d754fc2a687b680fg-02.jpg?height=397&width=511&top_left_y=1279&top_left_x=650)

An example of a sole proprietorship is a family-owned business. The individual owner usually uses savings or a personal loan to start the business and to run daily operations and retains full management control. The owner retains all return (profits), which is taxed as personal income, and is personally responsible for losses and obligations of the business, such as debts.

While sole proprietorships comprise the largest number of businesses in most market economies and are preferred by small business owners for their simplicity and flexibility, their growth is constrained by an owner's ability to access financing, assume risk, and serve as the sole owner.

## Partnerships

Partnerships allow multiple owners to pool their resources and share business risk and return. There are three common types in most jurisdictions: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.

A general partnership, shown in Exhibit 3, has two or more owners called partners or general partners (GPs). General partnerships are like sole proprietorships, with the important distinction that they allow for additional resources to be brought into the
business by the additional owners, along with the sharing of business risk and return. Partnerships are often formed and governed by a written partnership agreement that outlines specific partner roles and responsibilities and the sharing of profits, losses, and obligations. However, a written agreement is not required; partnerships can be formed verbally or incidentally through actions.

## Exhibit 3: General Partnership

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_4188d754fc2a687b680fg-03.jpg?height=495&width=716&top_left_y=617&top_left_x=859)

Examples of general partnerships include service businesses, such as builders or contractors, and joint ventures of multiple businesses. Such businesses have a small number of partners who usually contribute equal or similar amounts of capital. The partners bring complementary expertise, such as expertise in business development, financial acumen, operations, or legal/compliance, and they share responsibility in running the business. All profits, losses, and risks of the business are collectively assumed and shared by the partners. If one partner is unable to pay his share of the business's debts, the remaining partners are fully liable. As with a sole proprietorship, potential for growth is limited by the partners' ability to source financing and expertise and their collective risk tolerance because the partners are still personally liable for business losses and debt.

Exhibit 4 shows a type of partnership called a limited partnership, which addresses some of the shortcomings of general partnerships. In a limited partnership, there must be at least one general partner (GP) with unlimited liability that often manages the business. Remaining partners, however, called limited partners (LPs), have limited liability, meaning their losses are limited to the size of their investment in the limited partnership, and may not have any management responsibilities. With limited liability, personal assets are considered separate and thus protected from the obligations of the business. All partners are entitled to a share of the profits and losses as specified in the partnership agreement, with GPs typically receiving a larger portion in exchange for their greater risk and personal liability. Partnership agreements are customized and negotiated by the partners and can be highly complex, with multiple partnership tiers that have varying profit and loss sharing arrangements.

## Exhibit 4: Limited Partnership

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_4188d754fc2a687b680fg-04.jpg?height=342&width=1159&top_left_y=325&top_left_x=323)

In a limited partnership, while financial risk and reward are shared, such resources as capital and expertise are typically limited to what the partners can contribute, and limited partners usually grant managerial responsibilities to the GP, which entails risk. Partnership agreements are customized and often limit the transferability of ownership interest or expansion beyond a small group of partners. Like sole proprietorships, partnerships are typically pass-through businesses for tax purposes. Pass-through businesses are not taxed at the entity level, passing on all their profits or losses to the partners who are taxed personally. Business income from these entities is passed through and taxed regardless of whether income was actually distributed or retained in the partnership and reinvested.

In some jurisdictions, there is a special form of limited partnership known as a limited liability partnership (LLP), which does not require a general partner and is instead composed entirely of limited partners, thus resolving the risk of unlimited liability for the GP. Instead, all partners have limited liability, and the partners share in management responsibilities, typically appointing one or more partners as managing partners. In some jurisdictions, such as the United States, LLPs are permitted only for professional services firms, such as law, accounting, engineering, and architecture, and have limits on the number of partners and legal restrictions on equity investment.

## Limited Companies

Finally, a limited company has many similarities to limited partnerships but includes several more features that allow greater access to financing and expertise for growth. In many jurisdictions, there are two types of limited companies: private limited companies and public limited companies.

The private limited company is similar to a limited partnership. But the form includes limited liability for all owners, improved transferability of ownership interests by dividing ownership into units called shares that are more easily tradeable, and a distinction between owners and managers. Owners, known as shareholders or members, elect a board of directors to manage the company and authorize any distributions of profits to owners. Boards of directors typically appoint professional managers. Private limited companies are known by many names in different jurisdictions, including limited liability company (LLC) and $S$ corporation in the United States, G.K. in Japan, SARL in France, GmbH in Germany, and company with limited liability in China.

Exhibit 5: Organization of Limited Company
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_4188d754fc2a687b680fg-05.jpg?height=454&width=903&top_left_y=323&top_left_x=768)

In many jurisdictions, including the United States, private limited companies have legal limits on the number of owners and require votes for transferring ownership interest but are pass-through businesses (like LPs), meaning that taxes on business income are paid only at the shareholder, not company, level.

Finally, public limited companies, often called corporations, are similar to private limited companies but in most jurisdictions face no legal restrictions on the number of owners or ownership transferability, while still featuring limited liability and separation of ownership and management. For these reasons, public limited companies are the most suitable form for companies that seek to go public and are the dominant organizational form globally by revenues and asset values. However, public limited companies are disadvantaged in most jurisdictions compared to the other organizational forms in one respect: taxation. While other forms are taxed only on business income and loss at the owner (personal) level, public limited companies are taxed at the business level and again at the personal level if profits are distributed to shareholders. But if profits are retained and reinvested in the company, the shareholder level of tax does not apply, which makes this organizational form more suitable for companies intending to retain profits to fund investment.

Public limited companies are known by different names in different jurisdictions, including C-corporation in the United States, corporation in China, Société anonyme in France, AG in Germany, and K.K. or stock company in Japan. Examples are numerous, including most if not all well-known multinational companies.

## EXAMPLE 1

## Simon Property Group

Simon Property Group ("Simon") is one of the largest owners of retail real estate in the world, with over $\$ 33$ billion in assets. Its assets primarily include shopping centers in the United States and some retail properties in Europe and Asia. Simon is organized in two layers, each with a distinct organizational form.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_4188d754fc2a687b680fg-06.jpg?height=784&width=527&top_left_y=226&top_left_x=642)

The retail real estate assets are wholly owned by Simon Property Group L.P., a limited partnership. Its partners include Simon Property Group Inc., the general partner, and approximately 200 limited partners. The general partner has full managerial responsibilities and unlimited liability and has an ownership interest of $87 \%$ in the partnership.

Importantly, the general partner, Simon Property Group Inc., is itself a corporation. It is broadly owned by thousands of shareholders, including the founding family, which owns $8 \%$ of shares. Simon Property Group Inc. has a single asset: its partnership interest in Simon Property L.P.

Simon's structure allows co-investing with limited partners, full management control, and receiving most of the income from the assets, while benefiting from broad access to financing, because while the GP has unlimited liability, its shareholders have limited liability. Partnerships composed of entities with limited liability, such as corporations, are common because they shield the ultimate owners (in this case, shareholders of Simon Property Group Inc.) from business risk but allow for the sharing of profit and loss in the underlying business.

The key distinctions between sole proprietorships, partnerships, and public limited companies or corporations are outlined in Exhibit 6.

## Exhibit 6: Features of Sole Proprietorships, Partnerships, and Corporations

## EXAMPLE 2

## How Are Investment Funds Organized?

Investment funds are pools of capital contributed by one or more investors for earning returns and managing risks. Investment funds are like other companies in a market economy: They hire professional management to invest capital, sometimes with additional borrowed money, in various assets to achieve return objectives subject to risk constraints. Major differences between funds and other companies include employing few people directly, primarily investing in financial instruments rather than operating assets, diversification of assets, and having specific rather than general objectives (e.g., exceed a benchmark rate of return).

Two common organizational forms for investment funds are corporations and limited partnerships, as illustrated in the following two diagrams. When organized as a corporation, fund investors hold shares that represent their proportionate interests in the pool of underlying assets. When organized as a limited partnership, fund investors hold partnership units that either represent their proportionate interests in the pool of underlying assets or varying interests of specific assets.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_4188d754fc2a687b680fg-08.jpg?height=1452&width=898&top_left_y=226&top_left_x=456)
*In this structure, which will be discussed in greater detail later in the curriculum in lessons on alternative investment, fund managers typically create a wholly owned private limited company entity that serves as the GP to protect the fund manager from unlimited liability.

## QUESTION SET

1. Identify two features that distinguish a general partnership from a limited partnership.

## Solution:

Owner-manager relationship: The management of a general partnership is typically shared by the general partners, while in a limited partnership, the general partner often exercises most managerial responsibilities. Owner liability of business debts and obligations: In a general partnership, the partners are personally legally liable for business debt and actions undertaken by the company. In a limited partnership, only the general partner faces personal liability; limited partners' liability is limited to their investment in the partnership.
2. Match the following business attributes with the most appropriate organizational form.

| Business Attribute | Organizational Form |
| :--- | :--- |
| A. Significant capital needs | 1. Limited liability partnership |
| B. Single owner, desires simplicity | 2. Corporation |
| C. Company provides professional <br> services | 3. Sole proprietorship |

## Solution:

A. 2. Corporation
B. 3. Sole proprietorship
C. 1. Limited liability partnership

A company with significant capital needs will want broad access to financing. In such a case, the corporate organizational form likely is most appropriate.
For the single owner who desires simplicity, a sole proprietorship is a suitable mechanism. In some jurisdictions, it is the "default" organizational form and does not require registration.
Professional service companies, such as a law firm, require the owners to have the skill sets to manage the company. A partnership structure is suitable, and a limited liability partnership structure allows for the partners to share managerial control without any partner assuming unlimited liability.
3. If a company owner expects to have a significant need for financing, which of the following organizational forms is the least appropriate choice?
A. Corporate
B. Partnership
C. Sole proprietorship

Solution:
C is correct. A sole proprietorship is limited in financing to the owner's funds and by the amount the owner can borrow personally. A partnership expands access to financing by adding owners, spreading risk, and adding borrowing capacity. The corporate form provides for the broadest access to financing because there are no limits to the number of shareholders and, with limited liability, shareholders are relatively more comfortable with the company borrowing.
4. Fill in the blanks in the following sentence:
$\qquad$ liability is a benefit to the corporate organizational form, but the form does face a possible disadvantage because of $\qquad$ taxation of distributed business income.

## Solution:

Limited liability is a benefit to the corporate organizational form, but the form does face a possible disadvantage because of double taxation of distributed business income.
5. True or False: Partnerships are typically taxed at the entity level rather than at the individual partner level.
A. True
B. False

Solution:
B is correct. Partnerships are typically pass-through entities, meaning that business income earned by the partnership is passed through to the partners according to the terms of partnership agreement, and each partner is taxed at the personal level.

## KEY FEATURES OF CORPORATE ISSUERS

describe key features of corporate issuers

The prior lesson addressed several advantages of the corporate organizational form over others, such as limited owner liability, owner-manager separation, and improved access to external financing. In this lesson, we explore the features of corporations in greater depth. Corporations that raise capital in the financial markets, known as corporate issuers, are essential for financial analysts to understand, because they raise more capital from investors than even governments worldwide.

## Legal Identity

A corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its owners formed through the filing of articles of incorporation with a regulatory authority. Corporations share many of the rights and responsibilities of an individual and may engage in similar activities. For example, a corporation can enter into contracts, hire employees, sue and be sued, borrow and lend money, make investments, and pay taxes.

Large corporations frequently have business operations in many different geographic regions and are subject to each regulatory jurisdiction where

- the company is incorporated,
- the business is conducted, and
- the company finances itself
and for such activities as
- registration,
- financial and non-financial reporting and disclosure, and
- capital market activities (issuance, trading, investment).


## Owner-Manager Separation

A key feature of most corporations is the separation between those who own the business (the shareholders) and those who operate it, as represented by the board of directors and management. In a corporation, shareholders are largely removed from the
