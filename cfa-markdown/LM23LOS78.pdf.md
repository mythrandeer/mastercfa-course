## CASH CONVERSION CYCLE

explain the cash conversion cycle and compare issuers' cash conversion cycles

A company's business operations are usually composed of several sequential steps. For a company that makes and sells physical goods, its operations include acquiring materials, producing inventory, selling products to customers, and collecting cash. These activities are known as the issuer's operating cycle and occur once or many times over a year, as illustrated in Exhibit 1.

## Exhibit 1: Operating Cycle

These activities result in cash outflows and inflows that usually do not occur at the same time as the activity. For example, materials are purchased and received by a firm but may not be paid for in cash until weeks or months later. Goods are sold to customers, but cash may not be received until weeks or months later. Finally, inventory may take time to produce or be ready for sale, such as in the spirits industry, where an aged product like whiskey can take years before it is ready to be sold to customers.

Future cash inflows within the operating cycle are recorded as short-term assets on issuers' balance sheets, while future cash outflows within the operating cycle are recorded as short-term liabilities. Issuers' financial statements often use the terms and associated definitions in Exhibit 2 for different types of future cash inflows and outflows.

Exhibit 2: Selected Short-Term Assets and Liabilities

| Short-Term Asset | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| Accounts receivable | Amounts to be collected from customers for products or services sold |
| Inventory | Cost of products produced or purchased for sale |
| Short-Term Liability | Meaning |
| Accounts payable | Amounts owed to suppliers for products or services received |

These short-term assets and liabilities are recognized based on the performance or occurrence of an activity and are derecognized when the cash inflow or outflow occurs, as illustrated in Exhibit 3.

## Exhibit 3: Selected Short-Term Assets and Liabilities Recognition Criteria

| Short-Term Asset | Recognized When ... | Derecognized When ... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accounts receivable | Product or service is sold to customer on credit | Cash is received from customer |
| Inventory | Issuer takes ownership of materials, goods, supplies, etc. | Product is sold to customer |
| Short-Term Liability | Recognized When ... | Derecognized When ... |
| Accounts payable | Product or service is received, and issuer defers payment to supplier | Cash is paid to supplier |

We can use the average duration of each of these short-term accounts to construct a timeline for a company's operating cycle. The amounts of time that accounts payable, inventory, and accounts receivable are outstanding on the balance sheet are known, respectively, as days payable outstanding (DPO), days of inventory on hand (DOH), and days sales outstanding (DSO). The calculations of these amounts, known as activity ratios, will be discussed in detail later in the curriculum. An important quantity from this timeline for analysts is the cash conversion cycle: the amount of time between an issuer's paying its suppliers and receiving cash from customers (i.e., the time between derecognition of accounts payable and derecognition of accounts receivable). Formally, the cash conversion cycle, in days, is expressed in Equation 1 as:

Cash conversion cycle
$=$ Days of inventory on hand + Days sales outstanding - Days payable outstanding

Exhibit 4 depicts the cash conversion cycle on a timeline within the broader operating cycle.

Exhibit 4: The Cash Conversion Cycle

The cash conversion cycle is the number of days it takes a company to convert an inventory investment into cash receipts from customers. Therefore, the longer the cash conversion cycle, the longer a company needs financing to pay its bills, such as payroll, because it has not yet received cash from customers. In 2020, the average US-listed company had a cash conversion cycle of 78 days, though there was considerable variance by industry, as shown in Exhibit 5. Pharmaceutical manufacturers tend to have relatively long cash conversion cycles because they keep a considerable inventory of pharmaceuticals on hand. Airlines-a service business with minimal inventories of goods and mostly prepaid sales to customers in cash or credit cards-tend to have short cash conversion cycles.

The ideal scenario is a short or even negative cash conversion cycle, which means that cash invested in inventory is quickly returned for subsequent investment. A negative cash conversion cycle can result from receiving cash from customers before-in some cases, well before-suppliers are paid. This scenario results in cash that can be used elsewhere, reducing the need for alternative financing to fund operations.

## INDITEX'S NEGATIVE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE

Industria de Dise√±o Textil, S.A., known as Inditex, is an apparel designer, manufacturer, and retailer listed on the stock exchanges of Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, and Valencia. Its largest brand concept is ZARA, which specializes in fast fashion.

Inditex has a unique business model in apparel, in which it leverages its vertically integrated supply chain to design, make, and sell numerous limited runs of inventories, enabling it to keep up with and influence customers' changing fashion tastes. Inditex sells off-the-rack items directly to customers (who pay with cash or credit cards), eschews stocking inventory to mitigate fashion risk, and sources raw materials from a vast number of suppliers over whom it has considerable leverage on payment terms. As a result, Inditex has a negative cash conversion cycle, as shown in the table below.

| (in millions of EUR) | 2021 | 2020 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accounts receivable | 842 | 715 |
| Inventories | 3,042 | 2,321 |
| Accounts payable | 6,199 | 4,659 |
| Sales | 27,716 | 20,402 |
| Cost of goods sold | 11,902 | 9,013 |
| Days sales outstanding | 11 | 13 |
| Days of inventory on hand | 93 | 94 |
| Days payable outstanding | 190 | 189 |
| Cash conversion cycle | -86 | -82 |

Issuers can shorten their cash conversion cycle in several ways, including the following:

- Reduce days of inventory on hand by discontinuing products or product lines with low or niche demand, by negotiating with suppliers to do more frequent deliveries in order to establish "just in time" inventory levels, and by using data analytics to improve customer demand forecasts and to rationalize stocking levels.
- Reduce days sales outstanding by offering prompt-payment discounts to customers, imposing late fees, tightening credit standards, imposing upfront deposits or accelerating installment payments, and working with third-party collection agencies.
- Increase days payable outstanding by negotiating supplier contracts for longer terms. This approach may be feasible by establishing preferred suppliers-purchasing more in volume in exchange for better terms. However, it may result in suppliers charging higher prices or asking for deposits. The ability to lengthen days payable outstanding is highly dependent on the power dynamics between the company and its suppliers. If a company can purchase a critical component from only one supplier who sells to many others, it may not have the ability to negotiate better terms.

While extending days payable outstanding can improve the cash conversion cycle, suppliers typically offer discounts for prompt payment, such as requiring payment in 30 days but offering a $2 \%$ discount if payment is received within 10 days. If a company forgoes this discount in favor of paying in 30 days, it is implicitly borrowing from the
supplier for $30-10=20$ days at the cost of the forgone discount. One strategy is to borrow from a third party (e.g., a bank) at a relatively low interest rate, pay the supplier early to receive the prompt-payment discount, and later repay the bank. Such a strategy avoids the high cost of supplier financing but preserves cash, as shown in the following example.

## EXAMPLE 1

## Keown Corporation-Internal versus External Financing

Keown Corporation is an established manufacturer of custom paddleboards operating in the North American market. Keown operates its own manufacturing plant in Canada and sells its paddleboards exclusively through its website to avoid the cost of retail locations.

Most of Keown's sales take place during the North American summer season from May to August. Keown's customers expect orders to be filled immediately, so it must maintain substantial inventory to start the summer season or risk losing sales to competitors. Given the seasonality of the business, Keown is particularly focused on meeting customers' needs.

Since Keown lacks the necessary cash to pay its suppliers within 10 days, the CFO must decide whether to borrow from its bank at an effective annual rate (EAR) of $7.7 \%$ to take the prompt-payment discount offered by its supplier of materials or pay in 30 days. The terms from the supplier are $2 / 10$, net 30 .

1. Should Keown use the bank loan and pay the supplier within 10 days to receive the $2 \%$ discount, or simply forgo the discount and pay the supplier in 30 days?

## Solution:

To compare the relative cost of the bank loan with that of the trade credit, we can calculate the effective annual rate on the trade credit. Essentially, we are calculating the interest rate on a loan for which the interest cost is the forgone discount and the term is the additional time Keown gets to pay; in this case, $30-10=20$ days.

EAR of Supplier Financing
$=\left(\left(1+\frac{\text { Discount } \%}{100 \%-\text { Discount } \%}\right)^{\frac{\text { Days in Year }}{\text { Payment Period-Discount Period }}}\right)-1$
Effective Annual Rate of Supplier Financing $=\left(\left(1+\frac{2 \%}{100 \%-2 \%}\right)^{\frac{365}{30-10}}\right)-1$
Effective Annual Rate of Supplier Financing $=0.446$ or $44.6 \%$
Since the effective annual rate of $44.6 \%$ on the supplier financing is significantly higher than the $7.7 \%$ interest rate on the bank loan, Keown should borrow from its bank. That way, it will still be able to preserve cash but will pay a far lower interest rate on the financing.

A long cash conversion cycle may reflect industry or business model characteristics, but a longer cycle relative to competitors and a lengthening over time are of particular concern for analysts. A longer cycle may signal worsening customer demand, deteriorating customer financial health or credit quality, or the loss of bargaining power with suppliers.

## EXAMPLE 2

## Cash Conversion for US Discount Retailers

Consider the following activity ratios for large US discount retailers Walmart Inc., Target Corporation, Costco Wholesale Corporation, The TJX Companies, and Ross Stores for the 2021 calendar year, as shown below.

|  | Walmart | Target | Costco | TJX | Ross |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Days sales outstanding | 5 | 2 | 3 | 7 | 2 |
| Days of inventory on hand | 48 | 68 | 29 | 63 | 61 |
| Days payable outstanding | 47 | 75 | 34 | 47 | 63 |

1. Which company has the shortest cash conversion cycle? The longest?

## Solution:

Cash conversion cycle $=$ DSO + DOH - DPO
Cash conversion cycle for Walmart $=5$ days +48 days -47 days $=6$ days
Cash conversion cycle for Target $=2$ days +68 days -75 days $=-5$ days
Cash conversion cycle for Costco $=3$ days +29 days -34 days $=-2$ days
Cash conversion cycle for TJX $=7$ days +63 days -47 days $=23$ days
Cash conversion cycle for Ross $=2$ days +61 days -63 days $=0$ days
Target has the shortest cash conversion cycle of the five companies.
2. These companies accept payment from customers at the point of sale in either cash or a debit or credit card. Does this fact align with the activity ratios presented?

## Solution:

Yes, because days sales outstanding is small. Debit and credit card payments typically settle in a couple of days, and cash sales are settled immediately.
3. In examining annual reports, you find that approximately $54 \%$ of Costco's sales are food or food-related items, a larger percentage than that of the other companies, which sell a greater percentage of apparel and non-food items. Does this fact align with the activity ratios presented?

## Solution:

Yes. Companies like Costco that sell perishable goods tend to have a lower number of days of inventory on hand, because inventory must be sold soon after receiving it from suppliers or else it spoils.

In addition to the cash conversion cycle, another measure analysts use to assess the efficiency of business operations is the amount of working capital used by the firm, particularly its quantity relative to sales so that it can be compared across time and firms. There are several definitions of working capital in practice. We distinguish between total working capital, formally defined in Equation 2 as a broad measure, and net working capital, defined in Equation 3 as a measure that excludes items that are less related to the cash conversion cycle or business operations, such as cash, marketable securities, and short-term debt.

Current assets
Minus: Current liabilities
Total Working Capital

Current assets, excluding cash and marketable securities
Minus: Current liabilities, excluding short-term and current debt
Net Working Capital

To control for size and for comparability across firms, total or net working capital is often expressed as a percentage of annual sales.

Consider the information on Licht Vernieuwend N.V. for the fiscal year ending 31 December 20X2, as shown in Exhibit 6. The total working capital is the difference between the current assets of EUR335 million and the current liabilities of EUR220 million, or EUR115 million. The net working capital excludes cash, marketable securities, and short-term bank loans from the calculation, giving a net working capital of EUR225 million - EUR160 million = EUR65 million.

Exhibit 6: Total and Net Working Capital Extracted from the Licht Vernieuwend N.V. Balance Sheet for the Year Ending 31 December 20X2

| (in millions of EUR) |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cash | 40 |  |
| Marketable securities | 70 |  |
| Accounts receivable | 85 | 85 |
| Inventory | 130 | 130 |
| Prepaid accounts | 10 | 10 |
| Total | 335 | 225 |
| Accounts payable | 130 | 130 |
| Accrued expenses | 30 | 30 |
| Short-term bank loan | 60 |  |
| Total | 220 | 160 |
| Total working capital | 115 |  |
| Net working capital |  | 65 |

The cash conversion cycle and the ratio of working capital to sales are interrelated. Since receivables and inventories are often large components of short-term assets and payables are a large component of short-term liabilities, a short cash conversion cycle is associated with a low ratio of working capital to sales and vice versa.

## INDITEX'S NEGATIVE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE AND WORKING CAPITAL

Continuing the earlier example, owing to Inditex's business model-which includes prompt payment from customers for off-the-rack apparel, limited runs of inventories with fast turnover, and a vast number of suppliers over which it has leverage-Inditex has not only a negative cash conversion cycle but also negative net working capital and negative ratios of net working capital to sales, as shown in the table below.

| (in millions of EUR) | 2021 | 2020 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accounts receivable | 842 | 715 |
| Inventories | 3,042 | 2,321 |
| Accounts payable | 6,199 | 4,659 |
| Net working capital | -2,315 | -1,623 |
| As a \% of sales | -8.4\% | -8.0\% |
| Sales | 27,716 | 20,402 |
| Cost of goods sold | 11,902 | 9,013 |
| Days sales outstanding | 11 | 13 |
| Days of inventory on hand | 93 | 94 |
| Days payable outstanding | 190 | 189 |
| Cash conversion cycle | -86 | -82 |

A high ratio of working capital to sales may be a result of industry characteristics, such as in the spirits industry, where inventory must age for several years before being sold to customers, or in the pharmaceutical industry, where companies hold a large amount of inventory, sometimes to comply with regulations. Besides cases of necessity, as illustrated in Example 1, or cases of compliance with regulations, issuers are generally better off holding less working capital and either using capital elsewhere on higher-return projects or returning capital to investors.

|  | Shorten | Lengthen |
| Offering larger discounts to its customers for payments received before the due date <br> Paying suppliers sooner | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |


| Action | Effect on the Cash Conversion Cycle |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | Shorten | Lengthen |
| Lowering reliance on just-in-time inventory methods while increasing safety stocks of inventory |  | $\checkmark$ |
| Negotiating longer payment periods with its suppliers | $\checkmark$ |  |
| Tightening credit standards for its customers | $\checkmark$ |  |

2. Identify the issuer with the longest cash conversion cycle and explain the effects of that length on that issuer relative to the other issuers.

|  | Issuer A | Issuer B | Issuer C |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Days of inventory on hand | 20 | 35 | 15 |
| Days payable outstanding | 15 | 10 | 5 |
| Days sales outstanding | 30 | 25 | 30 |

## Solution:

Using:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Cash conversion } \\
& \text { cycle }
\end{aligned}=\begin{aligned}
& \text { Days of inventory } \\
& \text { on hand }
\end{aligned}+\begin{aligned}
& \text { Days sales } \\
& \text { outstanding }
\end{aligned}-\begin{aligned}
& \text { Days payable } \\
& \text { outstanding }
\end{aligned}
$$

|  | Issuer A | Issuer B | Issuer C |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Days of inventory on hand | 20 | 35 | 15 |
| Plus: Days sales outstanding | 30 | 25 | 30 |
| Minus: Days payable outstanding | 15 | 10 | 5 |
| Cash conversion cycle | 35 | 50 | 40 |

Issuer B has the longest cash conversion cycle, 50 days. By having the longest cycle, Issuer B is more reliant on alternative financing to support its operations relative to the other issuers.
3. Assuming no change in days sales outstanding and days of inventory on hand, an issuer in need of cash flow that forgoes the discount offered by its vendor for payments within 10 days and chooses to pay on the due date in 30 days is:
A. shortening its cash conversion cycle.
B. lengthening its cash conversion cycle.
C. not affecting its cash conversion cycle.

## Solution:

B is correct. The issuer that uses the vendor financing by delaying payments is increasing its days payable outstanding and thus lengthening its cash conversion cycle. The issuer is reducing its need for liquidity by taking advantage of the vendor financing at the cost of the forgone discount.
4. An issuer with limited cash flow is deciding which of its suppliers' credit terms are least costly. Which of the following credit terms offered to the issuer by its suppliers have the lowest effective interest rate?
A. $1 / 10$, net 50
B. $2 / 15$, net 40
C. $3 / 15$, net 60

## Solution:

A is correct. The implicit financing cost that the issuer faces when forgoing a discount that the supplier or vendor offers is based on the amount of the forgone discount and length of the payment period beyond the discount period; $1 / 10$, net 50 would permit the issuer to borrow for $50-10=40$ days at a cost of only $1 \%$ of the purchase price (the forgone discount). The calculations for the cost of financing for each set of credit terms, expressed as an effective annual rate, are as follows:

EAR of Supplier Financing
$=\left(\left(1+\frac{\text { Discount } \%}{100 \%-\text { Discount } \%}\right)^{\frac{\text { Days in Year }}{\text { Payment Period-Discount Period }}}\right)-1$
EAR of $1 / 10$, net $50=\left(\left(1+\frac{1 \%}{100 \%-1 \%}\right)^{\frac{365}{50-10}}\right)-1$
EAR of $1 / 10$, net $50=0.096$ or $9.6 \%$
EAR of $2 / 15$, net $40=\left(\left(1+\frac{2 \%}{100 \%-2 \%}\right)^{\frac{365}{40-15}}\right)-1$
EAR of $2 / 15$, net $40=0.343$ or $34.3 \%$
EAR of $3 / 15$, net $60=\left(\left(1+\frac{3 \%}{100 \%-3 \%}\right)^{\frac{365}{60-15}}\right)-1$
EAR of $3 / 15$, net $60=0.280$ or $28.0 \%$
5. An issuer is comparing a bank loan at a rate of $15 \%$ with taking advantage of a supplier's terms of $1 / 14$, net 30 , paying on day 14 . The best decision in terms of the lower cost of financing is to:
A. forgo the discount and use the supplier's financing to pay on day 30.
B. borrow from the bank to take advantage of the trade credit terms.
C. use either option because the cost of the bank loan and the cost of the trade credit are identical.

## Solution:

B is correct.
The cost of the supplier's trade credit, expressed as an effective annual rate, is $25.769 \%$, which is higher than the $15 \%$ interest rate on the bank loan.

EAR of Supplier Financing

$$
=\left(\left(1+\frac{\text { Discount } \%}{100 \%-\text { Discount } \%}\right)^{\frac{\text { Days in Year }}{\text { Payment Period - Discount Period }}}\right)-1
$$

EAR of $1 / 14$, net $30=\left(\left(1+\frac{1 \%}{100 \%-1 \%}\right)^{\frac{365}{30-14}}\right)-1$

| EAR of $1 / 14$, net $30=0.25769$ or $25.769 \%$ <br> A and C are incorrect, because the bank loan rate of $15 \%$ is lower than the effective annual rate, $25.769 \%$, on the supplier's trade credit. |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| 6. Consider the following balance sheet for an issuer: |  |
| Cash | 100 |
| Marketable securities | 20 |
| Accounts receivable | 600 |
| Inventory | 800 |
| Prepaid expenses | 30 |
| Property, plant, and equipment | 10,000 |
| Intangibles | 500 |
| Total assets | 12,050 |
| Accounts payable | 980 |
| Accrued expenses | 70 |
| Short-term debt | 1,000 |
| Long-term debt | 2,000 |
| Shareholders' equity | 8,000 |
| Total liabilities and equity | 12,050 |
| 7. The issuer's net working capital is closest to: |  |
| A. -500 . |  |
| B. 380 . |  |
| C. 500 . |  |
| Solution: |  |
| B is correct. Net working capital is defined as: |  |
| Current assets, excluding cash and marketable securities |  |
| Net Working Capital | Minus: Current liabilities, excluding short-term and current debt |
| Current assets, excluding cash and marketable securities: |  |
| Accounts receivable | 600 |
| Inventory | 800 |
| Prepaid expenses | 30 |
| Sum | 1,430 |
| Current liabilities, excluding short-term and current debt: |  |
| Accounts payable | 980 |
| Accrued expenses | 70 |
| Sum | 1,050 |
| Net working capital | 380 |
| A is incorrect, because cash, marketable securities, and short-term debt are mistakenly included in the calculation, resulting in the calculation of total working capital instead of net working capital. |  |

C is incorrect, because cash and marketable securities are mistakenly included in the calculation.
explain liquidity and compare issuers' liquidity levels

Liquidity for an individual asset or liability is its nearness to cash or settlement. Cash is already cash, so it is the most liquid asset, while inventories can take issuers significant time to sell and ultimately collect cash from customers and are thus less liquid than cash. Similarly, accounts payable due to a supplier in five days are more liquid than a lease payment due next month. Issuers report assets and liabilities on their balance sheet in descending order of liquidity. Assets and liabilities that are not expected to convert into cash or settle within 12 months are presented as long-term assets and liabilities. Exhibit 7 depicts the relative liquidity of short-term assets and liabilities.

Exhibit 7: Relative Liquidity of Short-Term Assets and Liabilities
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_5c9655e710295ad95465g-12.jpg?height=609&width=703&top_left_y=1273&top_left_x=868)

Liquidity for an issuer refers to its ability to meet its short-term liabilities. It is determined by the amounts and liquidity of its short-term assets and liabilities, which in turn are determined by an issuer's business model and cash conversion cycle. For example, if an issuer has 20 in total short-term liabilities and 100 in cash, it is highly liquid and will face no problem paying its short-term liabilities. If the reverse is true and the company has 20 in cash and 100 in short-term liabilities, the company will have to seek other sources of liquidity to meet its short-term liabilities.
