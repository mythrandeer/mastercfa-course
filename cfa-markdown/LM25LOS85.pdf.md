5. The amount and type of financing needed or the weights in the WACC calculation depend on the issuer's:
A. business model.
B. financial leverage.
C. proportion of fixed cost to total costs.

Solution:
A is correct. The amount and type of financing needed or the weights in the WACC calculation depend on the business model and the stage in the company's life cycle. Some businesses require large amounts of assets and are capital intensive. Other business models require less assets and are capital light.
B and C are incorrect because the proportion of fixed assets to total costs (operating leverage) and financial leverage are issuer-specific factors that influence the component costs of debt and equity.
6. Under Modigliani and Miller (MM), if one assumes no taxes and no financial distress cost, among other assumptions, the value of the company is:
A. determined by its capital structure.
B. determined solely by its expected future cash flows.
C. set so the value of levered company is greater than that of the unlevered company.

## Solution:

B is correct. MM showed that under a set of restrictive assumptions, including zero taxes, the firm's value is unaffected by its financing mix or capital structure. It is the firm's cash flow that is the primary determinant of value. If the market value of the company is not affected by its financing mix, then the value of the levered firm is equal to the value of the unlevered firm.

## THE COST OF CAPITAL

calculate and interpret the weighted-average cost of capital for a company

As discussed in prior lessons, issuers make capital investments that are expected to have a return on investment greater than the required rate of return. An issuer's required rate of return on its capital investments is derived from its investors' required rates of return, adjusted for specific risks in the project. If the issuer has exhausted its positive-NPV project opportunities, it should return capital to investors so they can invest elsewhere and earn their required rate of return. Not doing so would destroy value for investors.

For an issuer, its required rate of return is also known as its cost of capital. Since issuers use both debt and equity, the cost of capital is composed of the cost of debt and the cost of equity. As described in prior lessons, debt is less risky than equity for investors because it is a priority, fixed claim on a firm's cash flows while equity is a residual claim of indeterminate length. Additionally, debt is sometimes secured with an underlying asset that would be transferred to the debtholder in the event of
default, further reducing risk for the debt investor. Therefore, debt investors have lower required rates of return than equity investors because they take less risk; equivalently, an issuer's cost of debt is lower than its cost of equity financing.

An issuer's weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) blends its costs of debt and equity to obtain a single cost of capital. The WACC, after adjusting for any project-specific risks, is what issuers use as $r$ in NPV analysis and as the hurdle rate for IRR analysis.

The calculation of WACC is shown in Equation 1:

```
WACC $=($ Cost of debt $\times$ Weighting of debt $)+($ Cost of equity $\times$ Weighting of equity).
```

The estimation of each component of Equation 1 will be covered in much greater detail in lessons on fixed income and equity later in the curriculum. For now, note the following observations.

- The cost of debt for an issuer is debt investors' required rate of return on debt financing. The interest rate on existing unsecured loans and bonds is typically a good starting point. However, if we want a forward-looking measure, meaning the interest rate on new debt raised to finance a new project, we might instead look to what interest rates similarly situated companies have recently borrowed at. Additionally, in jurisdictions where interest expense is tax deductible, we reduce the nominal cost of debt by multiplying by ( 1 - Tax rate) to obtain an after-tax amount.
- The weightings of debt and equity are either their market value proportions or target weights provided by management, which are typically on a book value basis. Market value weights are more commonly used because book values reflect historical prices of debt and equity, while investors' opportunity costs are based on current market prices of debt and equity.
- The cost of equity for an issuer is equity investors' required rate of return. Unlike the cost of debt, we do not have a historical interest rate to observe as a starting point. We do know that the cost of equity is higher than the cost of debt because of equity's riskiness and because distributions to shareholders are not tax deductible.

One simplistic approach is to simply observe the historical returns on equities in general-because perhaps equity investors are expecting a similar rate of return going forward-and adjust that rate for the company-specific considerations we will discuss in the next lesson, such as how stable a company's cash flows are.

One long-running broad market index of stocks has increased by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10\% from 1928 to 2021, so 10\% is a starting estimate for the cost of equity we'll use for these lessons. Expected and required rates of return for equity investors are rich topics that will be discussed in more detail later in the curriculum.

- If an issuer has additional types of financing with different risk and return characteristics from those of debt and equity-for example, preferred stock and non-controlling interests-the weighted-average after-tax cost of that financing needs to be added to Equation 1 as well.


## KNOWLEDGE CHECK: COMPUTING WACC

1. Assume that ABC Corporation is financed with $40 \%$ debt and $60 \%$ equity. Also assume that interest expense is tax deductible. ABC Corporation wishes to maintain these proportions as it raises new funds.

ABC's debt investors' required rate of return, measured before taxes, is $4 \%$, and its equity investors' required rate of return is $10 \%$. If the company's marginal tax rate is $23 \%$, what is ABC's weighted-average cost of capital?

## Solution:

ABC's weighted-average cost of capital is $7.23 \%$ :
WACC $=[(1-$ Tax rate $) \times$ Pre-tax cost of debt $\times$ Weighting of debt $]+($ Cost of equity $\times$ Weighting of equity).
$\mathrm{WACC}=[0.04 \times(1-0.23) \times 0.40]+(0.10 \times 0.60)$.
$\mathrm{WACC}=7.23 \%$.

## DISCUSSION

If ABC's management maintains the company's current mix of financing

If its cost of equity increases by $1 \%$ ? What about if the company's tax rate changes? Write your responses on this lesson's discussion board on the LES.

As demonstrated in the prior module, capital investments increase firm value if their returns exceed required rates of return. The prior module focused on the return on investment as the main driver of value, but it is also clear that a lower required rate of return would increase NPV, too, or at least provide a lower threshold for value-creative investments. This forms the basis for one of the most common objectives for managers in capital structure decisions, the mix of debt and equity financing: Choose whichever one leads to the lowest WACC. However, the cost of debt and equity are not chosen by management but, rather, are determined in financial markets by investors, so it is a dynamic and non-trivial endeavor. The second objective of management in choosing a capital structure is, where possible and economical, matching the liquidity or time horizon with that of its capital investments.

## QUESTION SET

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_9aa3a38971376d2c8dc6g-3.jpg?height=107&width=101&top_left_y=2055&top_left_x=1706)

1. XYZ corporation has a capital structure of $30 \%$ debt and $70 \%$ equity, and interest expense is tax deductible. Debt investors require a before-tax return of $6 \%$, and equity investors' required return is $12 \%$. If the marginal corporate tax rate rises from $20 \%$ to $25 \%$, the change in the WACC is closest to:
A. $-0.09 \%$.
B. $0.09 \%$.

## C. $0.30 \%$.

## Solution:

A is correct. XYZ's WACC at a tax rate of $20 \%$ is calculated as follows:
WACC $=($ Weighting of debt $\times$ Cost of debt $)+($ Weighting of equity $\times$ Cost of equity)
$=(0.3)(6 \%)(1-0.2)+(0.70)(12 \%)=9.84 \%$.
XYZ's WACC at a tax rate of $25 \%$ is calculated as follows:
WACC $=(0.3)(6 \%)(1-0.25)+(0.70)(12 \%)=9.75 \%$.
Thus, WACC declines by $0.09 \%$ as the after after-tax cost of debt declines from $4.8 \%$ to $4.5 \%$.
2. True or False: Since the cost of debt and equity are controlled by the firm, managers can lower the cost of capital for the firm by reduce reducing the cost of debt and equity used in their capital allocation process.
A. True
B. False

Solution:
B is correct. This statement is false because the costs of debt and equity are not selected by management but are determined in financial markets by investors, though they are influenced by management's actions.

## Questions 3 and 4 relate to the following information:

Company X has the following on the right-hand side of its balance sheet:
Bonds \$400,000
Common stock (40,000 shares) \$600,000
Total liabilities and equity $\$ 1,000,000$

The price of Company $X$ stock is currently $\$ 20$ per share. The required return before tax on debt is $5 \%$, and the required return on equity is $10 \%$.
3. In calculating WACC for Company X , the weight for debt using book values for the balance sheet components is likely to be $\qquad$ than the weight for debt using market values for the balance sheet components.
A. lower
B. the same
C. higher

Solution:
A is correct.
The book value weights are computed as follows:
$W_{d}=\$ 400,000 / \$ 1,000,000=0.40$.
$W_{e}=\$ 600,000 / \$ 1,000,000=0.60$.
The market value of equity is equal to $\$ 20 \times 40,000$ shares $=\$ 800,000$.
The market value weights are computed as follows:
$W_{d}=\$ 400,000 / \$ 1,200,000=0.33$.

$$
W_{e}=\$ 800,000 / \$ 1,200,000=0.67 .
$$

Thus, the book value weight for debt (0.40) is higher than the market value weight (0.33).
4. If the marginal corporate tax rate is $20 \%$ and the stock price increases to $\$ 25$, the WACC for Company X is closest to:
A. $7.60 \%$.
B. $8.26 \%$.
C. $8.55 \%$.

Solution:
B is correct.
The book value weights are computed as follows:
$W_{d}=\$ 400,000 / \$ 1,000,000=0.40$.
$W_{e}=\$ 600,000 / \$ 1,000,000=0.60$.
The market value of equity is equal to $\$ 25 \times 40,000$ shares $=\$ 1,000,000$. The market value weights are computed as follows:
$W_{d}=\$ 400,000 / \$ 1,400,000=0.29$.
$W_{e}=\$ 1,000,000 / \$ 1,400,000=0.71$.
The appropriate weights for the WACC calculation are the market weights Company X's WACC, using the market weights, is calculated as follows:

WACC $=($ weighting of debt $*$ cost of debt $)+($ weighting of equity $*$ cost of equity)
$=(0.29)(5 \%)(1-0.2)+(0.71)(10 \%)=8.26 \%$
5. Fill in the blanks using the following two terms:
higher
lower
