distinguish clearly between opinions and facts. In preparing a research report, the member or candidate must present the basic characteristics of the security(ies) being analyzed, which will allow the reader to evaluate the report and incorporate information the reader deems relevant to his or her investment decision making process. ${ }^{1}$

The Handbook requires that limitations to the analysis and any risks inherent to the investment be disclosed. Furthermore, it requires that any report include elements important to the analysis and conclusions so that readers can evaluate the conclusions themselves.

## Follow-Up

The process does not end with the report. If an equity investment is made or a credit rating is assigned, periodic review is required to revise forecasts and recommendations based on the receipt of new information. In the case of a rejected investment, subsequent analyses may still be required should the security price or business conditions change. Follow-up may involve repeating all the previous steps in the process on a periodic basis.

## SCOPE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS

describe the roles of financial statement analysis

The role of financial statement analysis is to use financial reports prepared by companies, combined with other information, to evaluate the past, current, and potential performance and financial position of a company for the purpose of making investment, credit, and other economic decisions. Managers within a company perform financial analysis to make operating, investing, and financing decisions but do not exclusively rely on analysis of related financial statements because they have access to nonpublic financial information.

In evaluating financial reports, analysts typically have a specific economic decision in mind. Examples of these decisions include the following:

- Evaluating an equity investment for inclusion in a portfolio.
- Valuing a security for making an investment recommendation to others.
- Determining the creditworthiness of a company to decide whether to extend a loan to the company and if so, what terms to offer.
- Assigning a debt rating to a company or bond issue.
- Deciding whether to make a venture capital or other private equity investment.
- Evaluating a merger or acquisition candidate.

These decisions demonstrate certain themes in financial analysis. In general, analysts seek to examine the past and current performance and financial position of a company to form expectations about its future performance and financial position. Analysts are also concerned about factors that affect the risks to a company's future performance and financial position. An examination of performance can include an

[^0]assessment of a company's profitability (the ability to earn a profit from delivering goods and services) and its ability to generate positive cash flows (cash receipts in excess of cash disbursements).

Exhibit 2 shows how news coverage of corporate earnings announcements places corporate results in the context of analysts' expectations. Panel A shows the earnings announcement, and Panel B shows a sample of the news coverage of the announcement. Earnings are also frequently used by analysts in valuation. For example, an analyst may value shares of a company by comparing its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) to the P/Es of peer companies or may use forecasted future earnings as direct or indirect inputs into discounted cash flow models of valuation.

## Panel B: Excerpt from News Article: Sea Limited Reports Mixed Results, Suspends Revenue Guidance

Singapore-based Sea Limited (SE) reported second-quarter results early Tuesday that missed on revenue but beat on earnings. The company, however, said it will suspend guidance for its e-commerce unit, which accounts for about 60\% of company revenue.

The company reported revenue of $\$ 2.9$ billion, missing estimates of $\$ 2.98$ billion. It lost 61 cents a share, better than the estimated loss of $\$ 1.14$ a share, according to FactSet.

SE stock plunged 14.3\% during afternoon action on the stock market today.
Sea has one of the largest e-commerce and digital entertainment platforms in the Southeast Asia region. It also provides financial services.

The company said its decision to suspend revenue guidance was driven by a highly volatile and unpredictable macro environment.
"We think the right thing to do in this time of continuing heightened macro volatility is to prioritize efficiency and self-sufficiency," Chief Executive Forrest Li said in written remarks in the Sea Limited earnings report.

Sea's gaming unit, called Garena, accounts for about $31 \%$ of revenue.
"We are in an environment of increased macro uncertainty, with rising inflation, rising interest rates, local currency depreciations against the U.S. dollar, and ongoing reopening trends," said Li. "In this environment, being agile and adaptable is even more crucial to the long-term success of our business."

SE stock is down about $62 \%$ this year.

Analysts are also interested in the financial position of a company, particularly for credit analysis, as depicted in Exhibit 3. Panel A of the exhibit is an excerpt from an August 2022 T-Mobile's press release highlighting a series of credit rating upgrades that the company received from the three major rating agencies. Panel B of the exhibit is an excerpt from a July 2022 announcement from Moody's Investor Service about its upgrade of T-Mobile's credit rating.

Exhibit 3: Credit Rating Upgrade for T-Mobile

# Panel A: Excerpt from Announcement by T Mobile 

T-Mobile Secures First-Ever Full Investment Grade Rating

BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) today announced that following an investment grade issuer rating from S\&P Global Ratings (S\&P) - the third it has received from credit rating agencies - the company now has its first-ever full investment grade rating. S\&P has
assigned the Company a BBB- with positive outlook. This follows the company securing a Baa3 rating with a stable outlook from Moody's and a BBB- rating with a positive outlook from Fitch.

This full investment grade rating comes as a result of T-Mobile's successful operational and financial performance, which is consistently demonstrated through strong subscriber growth and the company's ability to translate that into increasing free cash flow.
"Achieving a full investment grade rating is an important milestone for T-Mobile that reflects the leading credit rating agencies' positive outlook on our Un-carrier leadership strategy that is rooted in an unwavering focus on putting customers first," said Peter Osvaldik, T-Mobile chief financial officer. "This 'clean sweep' in upgrades provides T-Mobile with the ability to unlock full access to the deep investment grade debt markets, which will further fuel our growth and momentum toward our mission of being the very best at connecting customers to their world."

## Panel B: Excerpt from Moody's Announcement About Rating Action on T-Mobile

## Rating Action: Moody's upgrades T-Mobile to Baa3; outlook stable

New York, July 20, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) upgraded T-Mobile USA, Inc.'s (T-Mobile) senior unsecured debt rating to Baa3 from Ba2 and affirmed the Baa3 rating on the company's existing senior secured notes and senior secured revolving credit facility.

Moody's has also withdrawn T-Mobile's Ba1 corporate family rating, Ba1-PD probability of default rating and SGL-1 speculative grade liquidity rating. With this rating action, Moody's changed T-Mobile's ratings outlook to stable from positive.

The ratings upgrade reflects T-Mobile's accelerated achievement of higher than expected operating cost synergies following its April 2020 merger with Sprint, significant and nearly complete network and operations integration and high visibility into the company's steady path towards sustained debt leverage (Moody's adjusted) below 3.75x. T-Mobile's sizable operating scale, high speed 5G coverage footprint, substantial upside growth potential in historically under-indexed rural and enterprise end market segments, solid incremental revenue growth adjacencies in fixed wireless access, extensive asset base and solid industry market position support continued subscriber growth, EBITDA margin expansion and ramping free cash flow over the next 12-18 months. The company's financial policy, which prudently focuses on network infrastructure investments to support market share growth, remains an important driver of the credit profile going forward. Moody's views network investments, including spectrum investments, as supportive of the business profile.

The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation for T-Mobile's continued subscriber and service revenue growth, EBITDA margin expansion, debt leverage (Moody's adjusted) declining steadily towards and sustained around 3.75x and rising free cash flow.

In conducting financial analysis of a company, the analyst will regularly refer to the company's financial statements, financial notes, and supplementary schedules as well as a variety of other information sources. The next lesson introduces commonly used information sources.

## REGULATED SOURCES OF INFORMATION

describe the importance of regulatory filings, financial statement notes and supplementary information, management's commentary, and audit reports

Regulatory authorities require publicly traded issuers to prepare financial reports in accordance with specified accounting standards and other securities laws and regulations. For example, in Switzerland, Swiss-based companies listed on the main board of the Swiss Exchange must prepare their financial statements in accordance with either IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) or US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) if they are multinational. ${ }^{2}$ While jurisdictions differ in their approach to securities regulations and corporate reporting standards, regulators of jurisdictions that oversee more than 95 percent of world's financial markets are members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and share objectives and principles, thereby creating a degree of global uniformity.

## International Organization of Securities Commissions

Although technically not a regulatory authority, IOSCO regulates a significant portion of the world's financial capital markets. This organization was formed in 1983 and consists of ordinary members, associate members, and affiliate members. Ordinary members are the securities commission or similar governmental regulatory authority with primary responsibility for securities regulation in the member country. ${ }^{3}$ The members regulate more than 95 percent of the world's financial capital markets in more than 115 jurisdictions, and securities regulators in emerging markets account for 75 percent of its ordinary membership.

IOSCO's comprehensive set of Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation is updated as required and is recognized as an international benchmark for all markets. The principles of securities regulation are based upon three core objectives: ${ }^{4}$

- protecting investors;
- ensuring that markets are fair, efficient, and transparent; and
- reducing systemic risk.
