In conducting financial analysis of a company, the analyst will regularly refer to the company's financial statements, financial notes, and supplementary schedules as well as a variety of other information sources. The next lesson introduces commonly used information sources.

## REGULATED SOURCES OF INFORMATION

describe the importance of regulatory filings, financial statement notes and supplementary information, management's commentary, and audit reports

Regulatory authorities require publicly traded issuers to prepare financial reports in accordance with specified accounting standards and other securities laws and regulations. For example, in Switzerland, Swiss-based companies listed on the main board of the Swiss Exchange must prepare their financial statements in accordance with either IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) or US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) if they are multinational. ${ }^{2}$ While jurisdictions differ in their approach to securities regulations and corporate reporting standards, regulators of jurisdictions that oversee more than 95 percent of world's financial markets are members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and share objectives and principles, thereby creating a degree of global uniformity.

## International Organization of Securities Commissions

Although technically not a regulatory authority, IOSCO regulates a significant portion of the world's financial capital markets. This organization was formed in 1983 and consists of ordinary members, associate members, and affiliate members. Ordinary members are the securities commission or similar governmental regulatory authority with primary responsibility for securities regulation in the member country. ${ }^{3}$ The members regulate more than 95 percent of the world's financial capital markets in more than 115 jurisdictions, and securities regulators in emerging markets account for 75 percent of its ordinary membership.

IOSCO's comprehensive set of Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation is updated as required and is recognized as an international benchmark for all markets. The principles of securities regulation are based upon three core objectives: ${ }^{4}$

- protecting investors;
- ensuring that markets are fair, efficient, and transparent; and
- reducing systemic risk.

[^0]IOSCO's principles are grouped into 10 categories, including principles for regulators, for enforcement, for auditing, and for issuers, among others. Within the category "Principles for Issuers," two principles relate directly to financial reporting:

- There should be full, accurate, and timely disclosure of financial results, risk, and other information that is material to investors' decisions.
- Accounting standards used by issuers to prepare financial statements should be of a high and internationally acceptable quality.

Historically, regulation and related financial reporting standards were developed within individual countries and were often based on the cultural, economic, and political norms of each country. As financial markets have become more global, it has become desirable to establish comparable financial reporting standards internationally. Ultimately, laws and regulations are established by individual jurisdictions, so this also requires cooperation among regulators. Another IOSCO principle deals with the use of self-regulatory organizations (SROs), which exercise some direct oversight for their areas of competence and should be subject to the oversight of the relevant regulator and observe fairness and confidentiality. ${ }^{5}$

To ensure consistent application of international financial standards (such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's standards and IFRS), it is important to have uniform regulation and enforcement across national boundaries. IOSCO assists in attaining this goal of uniform regulation as well as cross-border cooperation in combating violations of securities and derivatives laws.

## US Securities and Exchange Commission

The US SEC has primary responsibility for securities and capital markets regulation in the United States and is an ordinary member of IOSCO. Any company issuing securities within the United States (e.g., on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ), or otherwise involved in US capital markets, is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The SEC, one of the oldest and most developed regulatory authorities, was created by reforms after the stock market crash of 1929 that preceded the Great Depression.

From a financial reporting and analysis perspective, the most significant statutes enforced by the SEC are the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

- Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act): This law specifies the financial and other significant information that investors must receive when securities are sold, prohibits misrepresentations, and requires initial registration of all public issuances of securities.
- Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act): This law created the SEC, gave the SEC authority over all aspects of the securities industry, and empowered the SEC to require periodic reporting by companies with publicly traded securities.
- Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002: This law created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to oversee auditors. The SEC is responsible for carrying out the requirements of the act and overseeing the PCAOB. The act addresses auditor independence (it prohibits auditors from providing certain non-audit services to the companies they audit); strengthens corporate responsibility for financial reports (it requires executive management to certify that the company's financial reports fairly present the company's condition); and requires management to report on
> the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting (including obtaining external auditor confirmation of the effectiveness of internal control).

Companies comply with these acts principally through filing standardized forms created by the SEC and by responding to and complying with specific comments on their filings by the SEC staff. More than 50 different types of SEC forms are used to satisfy reporting requirements; the discussion herein is limited to those forms most relevant for financial analysts.

Most of the SEC filings are required to be made electronically, so filings that an analyst would be interested in can be retrieved online from one of many websites, including an issuer's investor relations website and the SEC's own website. Some filings are required on the initial offering of securities, whereas others are required on a periodic basis thereafter. The following are some of the more common filings used by analysts.

- Securities Offerings Registration Statement: The 1933 Act requires companies offering securities to file a registration statement. New issuers as well as previously registered companies that are issuing new securities are required to file these statements. Required information and the precise form vary depending upon the size and nature of the offering. Typically, required information includes (1) disclosures about the securities being offered for sale, (2) the relationship of these new securities to the issuer's other capital securities, (3) the information typically provided in the annual filings, (4) recent audited financial statements, and (5) risk factors involved in the business. Interim unaudited financial statements are also provided if the statement is filed three months or more after a fiscal year end.
- Forms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F: Companies are required to file these forms annually. Form 10-K is for US registrants, Form 40-F is for certain Canadian registrants, and Form 20-F is for all other non-US registrants. These forms require a comprehensive overview, including information concerning a company's business, risk factors, financial disclosures, legal proceedings, and information related to management. The financial disclosures include audited financial statements and notes, management discussion and analysis (MD\&A) of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and auditors' reports.
- Annual Report: In addition to the SEC's annual filings (e.g., Form 10-K), most companies prepare an annual report to shareholders. This is not a requirement of the SEC. The annual report is usually viewed as one of the most significant opportunities for a company to present itself to shareholders and other external parties; accordingly, it is often a highly polished marketing document with photographs, an opening letter from the chief executive officer, financial data, market segment information, research and development activities, and future corporate goals. In contrast, the Form $10-\mathrm{K}$ is a more legal type of document with minimal marketing emphasis. Although the perspectives vary, a company's annual report and its Form 10-K have considerable overlap. Some companies prepare only Form 10-K or publish an annual report that consists of a few pages of material and a copy of the 10-K.
- Proxy Statement/Form DEF-14A: The SEC requires that shareholders of a company receive a proxy statement before a shareholder meeting. A proxy is an authorization from the shareholder giving another party the right to cast its vote. Shareholder meetings are held at least once a year, but any special meetings also require a proxy statement. Proxies, especially annual meeting
proxies, contain information that is often useful to financial analysts. Such information typically includes proposals that require a shareholder vote, details of security ownership by management and principal owners, biographical information on directors, and disclosure of executive compensation. Proxy statement information is filed with the SEC as Form DEF-14A.
- Forms 10-Q and 6-K: Companies are required to submit these forms for interim periods (quarterly for US companies on Form 10-Q, and semiannually for many non-US companies on Form 6-K). The filing requires certain financial information, including unaudited financial statements and an MD\&A for the interim period covered by the report. Additionally, if certain types of non-recurring events-such as the adoption of a significant accounting policy, commencement of significant litigation, or a material limitation on the rights of any holders of any class of registered securitiestake place during the period covered by the report, these events must be included in the Form 10-Q report. Companies may provide the 10-Q report to shareholders or may prepare a separate, abbreviated, quarterly report to shareholders.


## KNOWLEDGE CHECK

1. In September 2017, Sea Ltd, the Singapore-based technology company, filed a registration statement with the US SEC to register its initial public offering of securities (American Depositary Shares, each representing one Class A Ordinary Share) on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition to a large amount of financial information, the registration statement provided over 50 pages of discussion on Sea Ltd.'s business and industry.

Which of the following is most likely to have been included in Sea's registration statement?
A. Underwriters' fairness opinion of the offering
B. Assessment of risk factors involved in the business
C. Projected cash flows and earnings for the business

Solution:
B is correct. Information provided by companies in registration statements typically includes disclosures about the securities being offered for sale; the relationship of these new securities to the issuer's other capital securities; the information typically provided in the annual filings; recent audited financial statements; and risk factors involved in the business. Companies provide information useful in developing projected cash flows and earnings but do not typically include these in the registration statement, nor do they provide opinions of the underwriters.

A company or its officers make other SEC filings-either periodically, or, if significant events or transactions have occurred, in between the periodic reports noted previously. By their nature, these forms sometimes contain timely information that may have significant valuation implications.

- Form 8-K: In addition to filing annual and interim reports, SEC registrants must report material corporate events on a more current basis. Form 8-K (6-K for non-US registrants) is the "current report" companies must file with the SEC to announce such major events as acquisitions or disposals of
corporate assets, changes in securities and trading markets, matters related to accountants and financial statements, corporate governance and management changes, and Regulation FD disclosures. ${ }^{6}$
- Forms 3, 4, 5, and 144: Forms 3, 4, and 5 are required to report beneficial ownership of securities. These filings are required for any director or officer of a registered company as well as beneficial owners of greater than 10 percent of a class of registered equity securities. Form 3 is the initial statement, Form 4 reports changes, and Form 5 is the annual report. Form 144 is notice of the proposed sale of restricted securities or securities held by an affiliate of the issuer. These forms can be used to examine purchases and sales of securities by officers, directors, and other affiliates of the company, who collectively are regarded as corporate insiders.
- Form 11-K: This is the annual report of employee stock purchase, savings, and similar plans. It might be of interest to analysts for companies with significant employee benefit plans because it contains more information about these plans than disclosed in the company's financial statements.

In jurisdictions other than the United States, similar legislation exists for the purpose of regulating securities and capital markets. Regulatory authorities are responsible for enforcing regulation, and securities regulation is intended to be consistent with the IOSCO objectives described in the previous section. Within each jurisdiction, regulators will either establish or, more typically, recognize and adopt a specified set or sets of accounting standards. The regulators will also establish reporting and filing requirements. IOSCO members have agreed to cooperate in the development, implementation, and enforcement of internationally recognized and consistent standards of regulation.

## Capital Markets Regulation in Europe

Each individual member state of the European Union (EU) regulates capital markets in its jurisdiction. Certain regulations, however, have been adopted at the EU level. Importantly, the EU agreed that from 2005 consolidated accounts of EU-listed companies would use International Financial Reporting Standards. The endorsement process by which newly issued IFRS are adopted by the EU reflects the balance between the individual member state's autonomy and the need for cooperation and convergence. When the IASB issues a new standard, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group advises the European Commission on the standard, and the Standards Advice Review Group provides the Commission with an opinion about that advice. Based on the input from these two entities, the Commission prepares a draft endorsement regulation. The Accounting Regulatory Committee votes on the proposal; and if the vote is favorable, the proposal proceeds to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union for approval. ${ }^{7}$

Two bodies related to securities regulation established by the European Commission are the European Securities Committee (ESC) and the European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA). The ESC consists of high-level representatives of member states and advises the European Commission on securities policy issues. ESMA is an EU cross-border supervisor established to coordinate supervision of the EU market. As noted earlier, regulation still rests with the individual member states and, therefore,

[^1]requirements for registering shares and filing periodic financial reports vary from country to country. ESMA is one of three European supervisory authorities; the two others supervise the banking and insurance industries.

## Financial Notes and Supplementary Schedules

The notes (also sometimes referred to as footnotes) that accompany the financial statements are required and often account for a large percentage of the financial disclosures made in regulatory filings. The notes provide information that is essential to understanding the information provided in the statements. Sea Ltd.'s 2021 financial statements, for example, include more than 60 pages of notes.

The notes disclose the basis of preparation for the financial statements. For example, Sea Ltd. discloses that its fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year; its financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP; the statements are thousands of US dollars unless otherwise specified; and the figures have been rounded, which might give rise to minor discrepancies when they are added. Sea Ltd. also states that its financial statements are on a consolidated basis-that is, aggregating the financial records of all its subsidiaries it controls, after eliminating intercompany balances and transactions.

The notes also disclose information about the accounting policies, methods, and estimates used to prepare the financial statements. Both IFRS and US GAAP allow some flexibility in choosing among alternative policies and methods when accounting for certain items. This flexibility aims to meet the divergent needs of many businesses for reporting a variety of economic transactions. In addition to differences in accounting policies and methods, differences arise as a result of estimates needed to record and measure transactions, events, and financial statement line items.

Overall, flexibility in accounting choices is necessary because, ideally, a company will select those policies, methods, and estimates that are allowable and most relevant and that fairly reflect the unique economic environment of the company's business and industry. Flexibility can, however, create challenges for the analyst because the use of different policies, methods, and estimates reduces comparability across different companies' financial statements.

For example, if a company acquires a piece of equipment to use in its operations, accounting standards require that the cost of the equipment be reported as an expense (depreciation) by allocating its cost, less any residual value, in a systematic manner over the equipment's useful life. Accounting standards permit flexibility, however, in determining the way each year's expense is determined. Two companies may acquire similar equipment but use different methods and assumptions to record the expense over time. An analyst's ability to compare the companies' performance is hindered by the difference. Analysts must understand reporting choices to make appropriate adjustments when comparing companies' financial positions and performance.

For many companies, the financial notes and supplemental schedules provide explanatory information about every line item (or almost every line item) on the balance sheet and income statement. In addition, note disclosures include information about the following (this is not an exhaustive list):

- segment reporting;
- business acquisitions and disposals;
- contractual obligations, including both on- and off-balance sheet debt;
- financial instruments and risks arising from financial instruments;
- legal proceedings;
- related-party transactions; and
- subsequent events (i.e., events that occur after the balance sheet date).

Experience using the disclosures made by a company and its competitors typically enhances an analyst's judgment about the relative importance of different disclosures and the ways in which they can be helpful.

## Business and Geographic Segment Reporting

Many companies are composed of several businesses. Although companies are not required to provide disaggregated full financial statements for all of its businesses or subsidiaries, they are required to provide some disaggregated information under both IFRS and US GAAP in the notes to financial statements by operating segment. An operating segment is defined as a component of a company that

- engages in activities that may generate revenue and create expenses, including a start-up segment that has yet to earn revenues;
- whose results are regularly reviewed by the company's senior management; and
- for which discrete financial information is available.

A company must disclose separate information about any operating segment that meets certain quantitative criteria-namely, the segment constitutes 10 percent or more of the combined operating segments' revenue, assets, or profit. (For purposes of determining whether a segment constitutes 10 percent or more of combined profits or losses, the criteria is expressed in terms of the absolute value of the segment's profit or loss as a percentage of the greater of (1) the combined profits of all profitable segments and (2) the absolute amount of the combined losses of all loss-making segments.) If, after applying these quantitative criteria, the combined revenue from external customers for all reportable segments combined is less than 75 percent of the total company revenue, the company must identify additional reportable segments until the 75 percent level is reached. Small segments might be combined as one if they share a substantial number of factors that define a business or geographical segment, or they might be combined with a similar significant reportable segment. Information about operating segments and businesses that are not reportable is combined in an "all other segments" category.

Companies must disclose the factors used to identify reportable segments and the types of products and services sold by each reportable segment.

For each reportable segment, the following should also be disclosed in the notes to financial statements:

- revenue, distinguishing between revenue to external customers and revenue from other segments;
- a measure of profit or loss;
- a measure of assets and liabilities (if these amounts are regularly reviewed by the company's chief decision-making officer);
- interest revenue and interest expense;
- cost of property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets acquired;
- depreciation and amortization expense;
- other non-cash expenses;
- income tax expense or income; and
- share of the net profit or loss of an investment accounted for under the equity method.

Companies also must provide a reconciliation between the information of reportable segments and the consolidated financial statements in terms of segment revenue, profit or loss, assets, and liabilities.

A company's reporting segments can be useful as a means of quickly understanding what a company does and how and where it earns money. The segment data shown in Exhibit 4 appear in the notes to the financial statements for Sea Ltd.

## Exhibit 4: Segment Reporting

## Excerpts from Note 22 (Segment Reporting) of Sea Ltd.'s 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F

The Company has three reportable segments, namely digital entertainment, e-commerce and digital financial services. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) reviews the performance of each segment based on revenue and certain key operating metrics of the operations and uses these results for the purposes of allocating resources to and evaluating financial performance of each segment.

## Description of Reportable Segments:

Digital entertainment - Garena's platform offers mobile and PC online games and develops mobile games for the global market. Garena is the global leader in eSports, it also provides access to other entertainment content and social features, such as live streaming of gameplay, user chat and online forums.

E-commerce - Shopee's platform is a mobile-centric, social-focused marketplace. It provides users with a convenient, safe, and trusted shopping environment with integrated payment, logistics infrastructure and comprehensive seller services. Products from manufacturers and third parties are also purchased and sold directly to buyers on Shopee platform.

Digital financial services - SeaMoney provides a variety of payment services and loans to individuals and businesses. It is an important payment infrastructure supporting the Company's digital entertainment and e-commerce businesses. In addition, SeaMoney also integrates with third party merchant partners and covers a broad set of consumption use cases.

A combination of multiple business activities that does not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments are grouped together as "Other services".

Segment Results for Year Ended 31 December 2021 (000s of USD)

|  | Digital Entertainment | E-Commerce | Digital Financial Services | Other Services | Unallocated Expenses | Consolidated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 4,320,013 | 5,122,959 | 469,774 | 42,444 | 0 | 9,955,190 |
| Operating income (loss) | 2,500,081 | (2,766,566) | $(640,422)$ | $(177,633)$ | $(498,520)$ | (1,583,060) |
| Non-operating loss, net |  |  |  |  |  | $(132,124)$ |
| Income tax expense |  |  |  |  |  | $(332,865)$ |

| Net loss |  |  |  |  |  | (2,043,030) |


| Revenue by Geography (000s of USD) |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Year Ended 31 December |  |  |  |
| Revenue: | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |
| Southeast Asia | 1,378,141 | 2,791,894 | 6,316,782 |
| Latin America | 282,618 | 790,308 | 1,850,861 |
| Rest of Asia | 489,291 | 655,007 | 1,394,342 |
| Rest of the World | 25,328 | 138,455 | 393,205 |
| Consolidated revenue | 2,175,378 | 4,375,664 | 9,955,190 |

From the data in Exhibit 4, an analyst can quickly see that the e-commerce segment accounted for just over 50 percent of total revenues in 2021 but generated a large operating loss, while the digital entertainment segment accounted for most of the remaining revenues and was the only profitable segment. An analyst would likely spend a majority of their time on examining the past and present, and forecasting the future results of these two segments. Similarly, an analyst would use these disclosures to understand that Southeast Asia and Latin America are the company's most important geographies.

Identifying segments requires significant judgment by management, and companies often change the definition of segments and related disclosures.

Another required disclosure is the company's reliance on any single customer. If any single customer represents 10 percent or more of the company's total revenues, the company must disclose that fact, though not the identity of that customer. From an analysts' perspective, information about a concentrated customer base can be useful in assessing the risks faced by the company.

## Management Commentary or Management's Discussion and Analysis

Regulatory filings such as Form 10-K and 10-Q include a section in which management discusses a variety of issues, including the nature of the business, past results, and outlook. This section is referred to by a variety of names, including management report(ing), management commentary, operating and financial review, and MD\&A.

The discussion by management is arguably one of the most useful parts of a company's annual report besides the financial statements themselves; however, other than excerpts from the financial statements, information included in the management commentary is typically unaudited. In Germany, management reporting has been required since 1931 and is audited.

To help improve the quality of the discussion by management, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued an IFRS Practice Statement "Management Commentary" includes a framework for the preparation and presentation of management commentary. The framework provides guidance rather than sets forth
requirements in a standard. The framework identifies five content elements of a "decision-useful management commentary": (1) the nature of the business; (2) management's objectives and strategies; (3) the company's significant resources, risks, and relationships; (4) results of operations; and (5) critical performance measures.

In the United States, the SEC requires listed companies to provide an MD\&A and specifies the content. ${ }^{8}$ Management must highlight any favorable or unfavorable trends and identify significant events and uncertainties that affect the company's liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations. The MD\&A must also provide information about the effects of inflation, changing prices, or other material events and uncertainties that may cause the future operating results and financial condition to materially depart from the current reported financial information. In addition, the MD\&A must provide information about off-balance-sheet obligations and about contractual commitments, such as purchase obligations. Management should also discuss the critical accounting policies that require them to make subjective judgments and that have a significant impact on reported financial results.

The management commentary, or MD\&A, is a good starting place for understanding information in the financial statements. In particular, the forward-looking disclosures, such as those about planned capital expenditures, new store openings, or divestitures, can be useful in projecting a company's future performance. However, the commentary is only one input for the analyst seeking an objective and independent perspective on a company's performance and prospects.

Sea Ltd's 2021 annual report on Form 20-F includes much information of potential interest to an analyst. The lengthy report contains sections such as "Information on the Company" and "Operating and Financial Review and Prospects" that discuss the company's history, business model, strategies, key performance indicators, risk factors, relevant laws and regulations, recent financial performance and position, cash flows and working capital, capital expenditures, and key accounting policies.

## Auditor's Reports

Financial statements presented in companies' annual reports are generally required to be audited by an independent accounting firm in accordance with specified auditing standards. The independent auditor then provides a written opinion on the financial statements. This opinion is referred to as the audit report. Audit reports may vary in different jurisdictions, but the minimum components, including a specific statement of the auditor's opinion, are similar. Audits of financial statements may be required by contractual arrangement, law, or regulation.

International standards on auditing (ISAs) have been developed by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This body has emerged from the International Federation of Accountants. ISAs have been adopted by many countries and are referenced in audit reports issued in those countries. Other countries, such as the United States, specify their own auditing standards. With the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the United States, auditing standards for public companies are promulgated by the PCAOB.

Under ISAs, the overall objectives of an auditor in conducting an audit of financial statements are

- to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, thereby enabling the auditor to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework; and
- to report on the financial statements, and communicate as required by the ISAs, in accordance with the auditor's findings. ${ }^{9}$

Publicly traded companies may also have requirements set by regulators or stock exchanges, such as appointing an independent audit committee within its board of directors to oversee the audit process. The audit process provides a basis for the independent auditor to express an opinion on whether the information in the audited financial statements presents fairly the financial position, performance, and cash flows of the company in accordance with a specified set of accounting standards.

Audits are designed and conducted using sampling techniques, and financial statement line items may be based on estimates and assumptions. This means that the auditors cannot express an opinion that provides absolute assurance about the accuracy or precision of the financial statements. Instead, the independent audit report provides reasonable assurance that the financial statements are fairly presented, meaning that there is a high probability that the audited financial statements are free from material error, fraud, or illegal acts that have a direct effect on the financial statements.

The independent audit report expresses the auditor's opinion on the fairness of the audited financial statements, and specifies which financial statements were audited, the reporting entity, and the date. An unqualified audit opinion states that the financial statements give a "true and fair view" (international) or are "fairly presented" (international and United States) in accordance with applicable accounting standards. This is also referred to as an "unmodified" or a "clean" opinion and is the one that analysts would like to see in a financial report. There are several other types of modified opinions. A qualified audit opinion is one in which there is some scope limitation or exception to accounting standards. Exceptions are described in the audit report with additional explanatory paragraphs so that the analyst can determine the importance of the exception. An adverse audit opinion is issued when an auditor determines that the financial statements materially depart from accounting standards and are not fairly presented. Finally, a disclaimer of opinion occurs when, for some reason, such as a scope limitation, the auditors are unable to issue an opinion.

The audit report also describes the basis for the auditor's opinion and, for listed companies, includes a discussion of Key Audit Matters (international) and Critical Audit Matters (United States). ${ }^{10}$ Key Audit Matters are defined as issues that the auditor considers to be most important, such as those that have a higher risk of misstatement, involve significant management judgment, or report the effects of significant transactions during the period. Critical Audit Matters are defined as issues that involve "especially challenging, subjective, or complex auditor judgment" and similarly include areas with higher risk of misstatement or that involve significant management judgment and estimates. However, Key and Critical Audit Matters are not necessarily the most important factors for analysts and investors.

[^2]Exhibit 5 presents excerpts from the independent auditor's report contained in Sea Ltd's 2021 annual report. Note that Sea Ltd. received an unqualified audit opinion (i.e., clean or unmodified opinion) from Ernst \& Young LLP for the company's fiscal year ended 31 December 2021.

## Exhibit 5: Excerpts from Sea Ltd's 2021 Independent Audit Report

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Sea Limited

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sea Limited (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and shareholders' equity (deficit) for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated April 22, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

## Recognition of Digital Entertainment ("DE") Revenue

## Description of the Matter:

For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company's revenue arising from DE was $\$ 4,320.0$ million.

As outlined in Note 2(o) of the consolidated financial statements, DE revenue is recognized over the performance obligation period. The Company has determined that an implied obligation exists to the paying users to continue providing hosting services and access to the purchased virtual goods within the online games over an estimated service period. Such service period is largely determined in accordance with the estimated average lifespan of the paying users of the said games or similar games.

Auditing the DE revenue recognition process was complex and involved judgement to determine the historical paying users' inactive rate and playing behavior, in estimating the average lifespan of the paying users of the said games or similar games. In addition, the Company utilized various operating systems to process user data and transactions and relied on automated processes and controls over the completeness and accuracy of the historical user and game data, which were key inputs to the above-mentioned estimates.

## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit:

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's DE revenue recognition process. For example, we tested the automated controls of the related operating systems. We also tested the effectiveness of management's review controls over assessing the completeness and accuracy of the historical user and game data and the appropriateness of the judgements regarding the most relevant historical user and game data to be applied in their estimates.

To test the recognition of DE revenue, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the above-mentioned underlying historical user and game data and assessing the reasonableness of the historical data applied in estimating the average lifespan of the paying users of the said games or similar games. We also recalculated the amount of revenue to be deferred based on management's estimated service periods and compared those amounts with the amounts recorded by the Company.

## Measurement of long-lived assets in E-commerce ("EC") segment

## Description of the Matter:

As at December 31, 2021, the Company's long-lived assets in EC segment amounted to approximately $75.7 \%$ of the Company's long-lived assets. The long-lived assets include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and intangible assets.

As outlined in Note 2(m) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Due to the continued losses incurred by EC segment, the Company evaluated the related long-lived assets for impairment at the asset group level by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the recoverable value determined by forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by this asset group.

Auditing management's long-lived assets impairment test was highly judgmental due to the magnitude of the carrying amount of long-lived assets and management's judgement in estimating the recoverable value (undiscounted cash flows) of the asset group, which were sensitive to key assumptions such as projected revenue and sales and marketing expenses.

## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit:

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's long-lived asset impairment process to determine the recoverable value of the asset group. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the key assumptions used in estimating the recoverable value.

To test the impairment of long-lived assets, our audit procedures included, among others, obtaining an understanding from management regarding the basis of which the undiscounted cash flows were prepared and assessing the reasonableness of the forecasted undiscounted cash flows by comparing them against the Company's business strategies and underlying key assumptions over the forecast periods, taking into consideration current industry and economic trends. We performed sensitivity analyses over the key assumptions described above to evaluate the changes to the estimated recoverable value for the asset group that would result from changes in the assumptions.

In the United States, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the auditors must also express an opinion on the company's internal control systems. This information may be provided in a separate opinion or incorporated as a paragraph in the opinion related to the financial statements. Internal controls are the company's processes, personnel, and systems designed to ensure that the company's process for generating financial reports is sound. Although management has always been responsible for maintaining effective internal control, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act greatly increases management's responsibility for demonstrating that the company's internal controls are effective. Management of publicly traded companies in the United States are now required by securities regulators to explicitly accept responsibility for the effectiveness of internal control, evaluate the effectiveness of internal control using suitable control criteria, support the evaluation with sufficient competent evidence, and provide a report on internal control.

Although these reports and attestations provide some assurances to analysts, they are not infallible. The analyst must always use a degree of healthy skepticism when analyzing financial statements.
