| USD209.1 million (USD0.53 per diluted share). Net income was USD338.0 million (USD0.79 per diluted share) for the 17-week fourth quarter of 2008. <br> - In the fourth quarter of 2009, Safeway recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of USD1,974.2 million (USD1,818.2 million, net of tax). The impairment was due primarily to Safeway's reduced market capitalization and a weak economy. . . . The goodwill originated from previous acquisitions. <br> - Safeway's balance sheet as of 2 January 2010 showed goodwill of USD426.6 million and total assets of USD14,963.6 million. The company's balance sheet as of 3 January 2009 showed goodwill of USD2,390.2 million and total assets of USD17,484.7 million. |
| :--- |
| 1. How significant was this goodwill impairment charge? <br> Solution: <br> The goodwill impairment was more than 80 percent of the total value of goodwill and 11 percent of total assets, so it was clearly significant. (The charge of USD1,974.2 million equals 82.6 percent of the USD2,390.2 million of goodwill at the beginning of the year and 11.3 percent of the USD17,484.7 million total assets at the beginning of the year.) |
| 2. With reference to acquisition prices, what might this goodwill impairment indicate? <br> Solution: <br> The goodwill had originated from previous acquisitions. The impairment charge implies that the acquired operations are now worth less than the price that was paid for their acquisition. |

As presented in Exhibits 2 and 3, SAPâ€™s 2017 balance sheet shows EUR21,274 million of goodwill, and Apple's 2017 balance sheet shows goodwill of USD5,717 million. Goodwill represents 50.1 percent of SAP's total assets and only 1.5 percent of Apple's total assets. An analyst may be concerned that goodwill represents such a high proportion of SAP's total assets.

## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to financial instruments

IFRS defines a financial instrument as a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity, and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. ${ }^{4}$ This lesson focuses on financial assets, such as a company's investments in stocks issued by another company or its investments in the notes, bonds, or other fixed-income instruments issued by another company (or issued by a governmental entity). Financial liabilities, such as notes payable and bonds payable issued by the company, will be discussed later. Some financial instruments may be classified as either an asset or a liability

[^0]depending on the contractual terms and current market conditions. One example of such a financial instrument is a derivative. Derivatives are financial instruments for which the value is derived based on some underlying factor (interest rate, exchange rate, commodity price, security price, or credit rating) and for which little or no initial investment is required.

Financial instruments are generally recognized when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. In general, the two basic alternative ways that financial instruments are measured subsequent to initial acquisition are fair value or amortized cost. Recall that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market transaction. ${ }^{5}$ The amortized cost of a financial asset (or liability) is the amount at which it was initially recognized, minus any principal repayments, plus or minus any amortization of discount or premium, and minus any reduction for impairment.

Under IFRS, financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost if the asset's cash flows occur on specified dates and consist solely of principal and interest, and if the business model is to hold the asset to maturity. The concept is similar in US GAAP, where this category of asset is referred to as held-to-maturity. An example is an investment in a long-term bond issued by another company or by a government; the value of the bond will fluctuate, for example with interest rate movements, but if the bond is classified as a held-to-maturity investment, it will be measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet of the investing company. Other types of financial assets measured at amortized cost are loans to other companies.

For financial instruments measured at fair value, the two basic alternatives in how net changes in fair value are recognized are (1) as profit or loss on the income statement, or (2) as other comprehensive income (loss), which bypasses the income statement. Note that these alternatives refer to unrealized changes in fair value, that is, changes in the value of a financial asset that has not been sold and is still owned at the end of the period. Unrealized gains and losses also are referred to as holding period gains and losses. Realized gains or losses as a result of a sale are reported on the income statement.

Under IFRS, financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (i.e., any unrealized holding gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income) if the business model's objective involves both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets. This IFRS category applies specifically to debt investments, namely assets with cash flows occurring on specified dates and consisting solely of principal and interest. However, IFRS also permits equity investments to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if, at the time a company buys an equity investment, the company decides to make an irrevocable election to measure the asset in this manner. ${ }^{6}$ The concept is similar to the US GAAP investment category available-for-sale in which assets are measured at fair value, with any unrealized holding gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income. Unlike IFRS, however, the US GAAP category available-for-sale applies only to debt securities and is not permitted for investments in equity securities. ${ }^{7}$

Under IFRS, financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (i.e., any unrealized holding gains or losses are recognized in the income statement) if they are not assigned to either of the other two measurement categories described earlier. In addition, IFRS allows a company to make an irrevocable election at acquisition to measure a financial asset in this category. Under US GAAP, all investments in equity securities (other than investments giving rise to ownership

[^1]positions that confer significant influence over the investee) are measured at fair value with unrealized holding gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Under US GAAP, debt securities designated as trading securities are also measured at fair value with unrealized holding gains or losses recognized in the income statement. The trading securities category pertains to a debt security that is acquired with the intent of selling it rather than holding it to collect the interest and principal payments.

Exhibit 4 summarizes how various financial assets are classified and measured subsequent to acquisition.

## Exhibit 4: Measurement of Financial Assets

| Measured at Cost or Amortized Cost | Measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income | Measured at Fair Value through Profit and Loss |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| - Debt securities that are to be held to maturity. <br> - Loans and notes receivable <br> - Unquoted equity instruments (in limited circumstances in which the fair value is not reliably measurable, cost may serve as a proxy [estimate] for fair value) | - "Available-for-sale" debt securities (US GAAP); debt securities for which the business model involves both collecting interest and principal and selling the security (IFRS) <br> - Equity investments for which the company irrevocably elects this measurement at acquisition (IFRS only) | - All equity securities unless the investment gives the investor significant influence (US GAAP only) <br> - "Trading" debt securities (US GAAP) <br> - Securities not assigned to either of the other two categories, or investments for which the company irrevocably elects this measurement at acquisition (IFRS only) |

To illustrate the different accounting treatments of the gains and losses on financial assets, consider an entity that invests EUR100,000,000 on 1 January 202X in a fixed-income security investment, with a 5 percent coupon paid semi-annually. After six months, the company receives the first coupon payment of EUR2,500,000. Additionally, market interest rates have declined such that the value of the fixed-income investment has increased by EUR2,000,000 as of 30 June 202X. Exhibit 5 illustrates how this situation will be portrayed on the balance sheet and income statement (ignoring taxes) of the entity concerned, under each of the following three measurement categories of financial assets: assets held for trading purposes, assets available for sale, and held-to-maturity assets.

## Exhibit 5: Accounting for Gains and Losses on Marketable Securities

| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Cost of securities | $100,000,000$ | $100,000,000$ | $100,000,000$ |


| IFRS Categories | Measured at Cost or Amortized Cost | Measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income | Measured at Fair Value through Profit and Loss |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Unrealized gains on securities | - | 2,000,000 | 2,000,000 |
|  | 102,500,000 | 104,500,000 | 104,500,000 |
| Liabilities |  |  |  |
| Equity |  |  |  |
| Paid-in capital | 100,000,000 | 100,000,000 | 100,000,000 |
| Retained earnings | 2,500,000 | 2,500,000 | 4,500,000 |
| Accumulated other comprehensive income | - | 2,000,000 | - |
|  | 102,500,000 | 104,500,000 | 104,500,000 |

In the case of securities classified as Measured at Cost or Amortized Cost, or equivalently held-to-maturity (US GAAP), the income statement shows only the interest income (which is then reflected in retained earnings on the ending balance sheet). Because the securities are measured at cost rather than at fair value, no unrealized gain is recognized. On the balance sheet, the investment asset is shown at its amortized cost of EUR100,000,000.

In the case of securities classified as Measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (IFRS), or equivalently as Available-for-Sale debt securities (US GAAP), the income statement shows only the interest income (which is then reflected in retained earnings on the ending balance sheet). The unrealized gain does not appear on the income statement; instead, it would appear on a Statement of Comprehensive Income as Other Comprehensive Income. On the balance sheet, the investment asset is shown at its fair value of EUR102,000,000. (Exhibit 5 shows the unrealized gain on a separate line solely to highlight the impact of the change in value. In practice, the investments would be shown at their fair value on a single line.) In the case of securities classified as Measured at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (IFRS), or equivalently as trading debt securities (US GAAP), both the interest income and the unrealized gain are included on the income statement and thus are reflected in retained earnings on the balance sheet.

From the information presented in Exhibits 2 and 6, SAP's 2017 balance sheet shows other financial assets of EUR990 million (current, Exhibit 6) and EUR1,155 million (non-current, Exhibit 2). The company's notes disclose that the largest component of the current financial assets are loans and other financial receivables (EUR793 million) and the largest component of the non-current financial assets is EUR827 million of available-for-sale equity investments.

In Exhibits 3 and 7, Apple's 2017 balance sheet shows USD53,892 million of short-term marketable securities (current, Exhibit 7) and USD194,714 million of long-term marketable securities (non-current, Exhibit 3). In total, marketable securities represent more than 66 percent of Apple's USD375.3 billion in total assets. Marketable securities plus cash and cash equivalents represent around 72 percent of the company's total assets. Apple's notes disclose that most of the company's marketable securities are fixed-income securities issued by the US government or its agencies (USD60,237 million) and by other companies, including commercial paper (USD153,451 million).

In accordance with its investment policy, Apple invests in highly rated securities (which the company defines as investment grade) and limits its credit exposure to any one issuer. The company classifies its marketable securities as available for sale and reports them on the balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in other comprehensive income.
explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to non-current liabilities

All liabilities that are not classified as current are considered to be non-current or long-term. Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 9 present balance sheet excerpts for SAP Group and Apple Inc. showing the line items for the companies' non-current liabilities.

Both companies' balance sheets show non-current unearned revenue (deferred income for SAP Group and deferred revenue for Apple). These amounts represent unearned revenue relating to goods and services expected to be delivered in periods beyond 12 months following the reporting period. The sections that follow focus on two common types of non-current (long-term) liabilities: long-term financial liabilities and deferred tax liabilities.
