In accordance with its investment policy, Apple invests in highly rated securities (which the company defines as investment grade) and limits its credit exposure to any one issuer. The company classifies its marketable securities as available for sale and reports them on the balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in other comprehensive income.
explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to non-current liabilities

All liabilities that are not classified as current are considered to be non-current or long-term. Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 9 present balance sheet excerpts for SAP Group and Apple Inc. showing the line items for the companies' non-current liabilities.

Both companies' balance sheets show non-current unearned revenue (deferred income for SAP Group and deferred revenue for Apple). These amounts represent unearned revenue relating to goods and services expected to be delivered in periods beyond 12 months following the reporting period. The sections that follow focus on two common types of non-current (long-term) liabilities: long-term financial liabilities and deferred tax liabilities.

## Long-Term Financial Liabilities

Typical long-term financial liabilities include loans (i.e., borrowings from banks) and notes or bonds payable (i.e., fixed-income securities issued to investors). Liabilities such as loans payable and bonds payable are usually reported at amortized cost on the balance sheet. At maturity, the amortized cost of the bond (carrying amount) will be equal to the face value of the bond. For example, if a company issues USD $10,000,000$ of bonds at par value, the bonds are reported as a long-term liability of USD10 million. The carrying amount (amortized cost) from the date of issue to the date of maturity remains at USD10 million. As another example, if a company issues USD10,000,000 of bonds at a price of 97.50 percent of par value (a discount to par), the bonds are reported as a liability of USD9,750,000 at issue date. Over the bond's life, the discount of USD250,000 is amortized so that the bond will be reported as a liability of USD10,000,000 at maturity. Similarly, any bond premium would be amortized for bonds issued at a price in excess of par value.

In certain cases, liabilities such as bonds issued by a company are reported at fair value. Those cases include financial liabilities held for trading, derivatives that are a liability to the company, and some non-derivative instruments, such as those which are hedged by derivatives.

SAP's balance sheet in Exhibit 8 shows EUR5,034 million in financial liabilities, and the notes disclose that these liabilities are mostly for bonds payable. Apple's balance sheet in Exhibit 9 shows USD97,207 million in long-term debt, and the notes disclose that this debt includes floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities.

## Deferred Tax Liabilities

Deferred tax liabilities result from temporary timing differences between a company's income as reported for tax purposes (taxable income) and income as reported for financial statement purposes (reported income). Deferred tax liabilities result when taxable income, and the actual income tax payable in a period based on it, is less than the reported financial statement income before taxes and the income tax expense based on it. Deferred tax liabilities are defined as the amounts of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences. ${ }^{8}$ In contrast, in the previous discussion of unearned revenue, inclusion of revenue in taxable income in an earlier period created a deferred tax asset (essentially prepaid tax).

Deferred tax liabilities typically arise when some expenses are included in taxable income in earlier periods than for financial statement net income. This results in taxable income being less than income before taxes in the earlier periods. As a result, taxes payable based on taxable income are less than income tax expense based on accounting income before taxes. The difference between taxes payable and income tax expense results in a deferred tax liability-for example, when companies use accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes and straight-line depreciation methods for financial statement purposes. Deferred tax liabilities also arise when some income is included in taxable income in later periods-for example, when a company's subsidiary has profits that have not yet been distributed and thus have not yet been taxed.

SAP's balance sheet in Exhibit 8 shows EUR240 million of deferred tax liabilities. Apple's balance sheet in Exhibit 9 does not show a separate line item for deferred tax liabilities; however, note disclosures indicate that most of the USD40,415 million of other non-current liabilities reported on Apple's balance sheet represents deferred tax liabilities, which totaled USD31,504 million.

Non-current liabilities will be explored in greater detail in a later learning module.

# RATIOS AND COMMON-SIZE ANALYSIS 

calculate and interpret common-size balance sheets and related financial ratios

Analysis of a company's balance sheet can provide insight into the company's liquidity and solvency-as of the balance sheet date-as well as the economic resources the company controls. Liquidity refers to a company's ability to meet its short-term financial commitments. Assessments of liquidity focus on a company's ability to convert assets to cash to pay for operating needs. Solvency refers to a company's ability to meet its financial obligations over the longer term. Assessments of solvency focus on the company's financial structure and its ability to pay long-term financing obligations. This lesson describes two tools for analyzing the balance sheet: common-size analysis and balance sheet ratios.
