- Pro forma earnings (also commonly referred to as non-GAAP or non-IFRS earnings) adjust earnings as reported on the income statement. Pro forma earnings that exclude negative items are a hallmark of aggressive presentation choices.
- Companies are required to make additional disclosures when presenting any non-GAAP or non-IFRS metric.
- Managers' considerable flexibility in choosing their companies' accounting policies and in formulating estimates provides opportunities for aggressive accounting.
- Examples of accounting choices that affect earnings and balance sheets include inventory cost flow assumptions, estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable, estimated realizability of deferred tax assets, depreciation method, estimated salvage value of depreciable assets, and estimated useful life of depreciable assets.
- Cash flow from operations is an important metric for investors that can be enhanced by management's operating choices, such as stretching accounts payable, and potentially by classification choices.


## CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW

compare financial reporting quality with the quality of reported results (including quality of earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet items)

Ideally, analysts would always have access to financial reports that are based on sound financial reporting standards, such as those from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and that are free from manipulation. But, in practice, the quality of financial reports can vary greatly. High-quality financial reporting provides information that is useful to analysts in assessing a company's performance and prospects. Low-quality financial reporting contains inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete information.

Extreme lapses in financial reporting quality have given rise to high-profile scandals that resulted not only in investor losses but also in reduced confidence in the financial system. Financial statement users who were able to accurately assess financial reporting quality were better positioned to avoid losses. These lapses illustrate the challenges analysts face as well as the potential costs of failing to recognize practices that result in misleading or inaccurate financial reports. ${ }^{1}$ Examples of misreporting can provide an analyst with insight into various signals that may indicate poor-quality financial reports.

This module addresses financial reporting quality, which pertains to the quality of information in financial reports, including disclosures in notes. High-quality reporting provides decision-useful information, which is relevant and faithfully represents the economic reality of the company's activities during the reporting period as well as the company's financial condition at the end of the period. A separate but interrelated

attribute of quality is quality of reported results or earnings quality, which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company's actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition. The term "earnings quality" is commonly used in practice and will be used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings, cash flow, or balance sheet items. High-quality earnings result from activities that a company likely will be able to sustain in the future and provide a sufficient return on the company's investment. The concepts of earnings quality and financial reporting quality are interrelated because a correct assessment of earnings quality is possible only when there is some basic level of financial reporting quality. Beyond this basic level, as the quality of reporting increases, the ability of financial statement users to correctly assess earnings quality and to develop expectations for future performance also increases.

After providing a conceptual overview of reporting quality, this module discusses motivations that might cause, and conditions that might enable, management to issue financial reports that are not high quality and mechanisms that aim to provide discipline to financial reporting quality. We also describe choices made by management that can affect financial reporting quality-presentation choices, accounting methods, and estimates-as well as warning signs of poor-quality financial reporting.

## Conceptual Overview

Financial reporting quality and results or earnings quality are interrelated attributes of quality. Exhibit 1 illustrates this interrelationship and its implications.

Exhibit 1: Relationships between Financial Reporting Quality and Earnings Quality

Financial Reporting Quality

|  |  | Low | High |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Earnings (Results) Quality | High Low | LOW financial reporting quality impedes assessment of earnings quality and impedes valuation. | HIGH financial reporting quality enables assessment. HIGH earnings quality increases company value. |
|  |  |  | HIGH financial reporting quality enables assessment. LOW earnings quality decreases company value. |

As shown in Exhibit 1, if financial reporting quality is low, the information provided is of little use in assessing the company's performance, and thus in making investment and other decisions.

Financial reporting quality varies across companies. High-quality reports contain information that is relevant, complete, neutral, and free from error. The lowest-quality reports contain information that is pure fabrication. Earnings (results) quality can range from high and sustainable to low and unsustainable. Providers of resources prefer high and sustainable earnings. Combining the two measures of quality-financial reporting and earnings-the overall quality of financial reports from a user perspective can be thought of as spanning a continuum from the highest to the lowest. Exhibit 2 presents a quality spectrum that provides a basis for evaluating better versus poorer quality reports. This spectrum ranges from reports that are of high financial reporting quality and reflect high and sustainable earnings quality to reports that are not useful because of poor financial reporting quality.

## GAAP, DECISION USEFUL FINANCIAL REPORTING

describe a spectrum for assessing financial reporting quality

At the top of the spectrum, labeled in Exhibit 2 as "GAAP, decision-useful, sustainable, and adequate returns," are high-quality reports that provide useful information about high-quality earnings.

- High-quality financial reports conform to the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of the jurisdiction, such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), US GAAP, or other home-country GAAP. The exhibit uses the term GAAP to refer generically to the accounting standards accepted in a company's jurisdiction.
- In addition to conforming to GAAP, high-quality financial reports also embody the characteristics of decision-useful information, such as those defined in the Conceptual Framework. ${ }^{2}$ Recall that the fundamental characteristics of useful information are relevance and faithful representation. Relevant information is defined as information that can affect a decision and encompasses the notion of materiality. (Information is considered material if

[^0]:    2 The characteristics of decision-useful information are identical under IFRS and US GAAP. In September 2010, the IASB adopted the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting in place of the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements (1989). The Conceptual Framework represents the partial completion of a joint convergence project between the IASB and FASB on an updated framework. The Conceptual Framework (2010) contains two updated chapters: "The Objective of Financial Reporting" and "Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Financial Information." The remainder of the material in the Conceptual Framework is from the Framework (1989) and will be updated as the project is completed. Also in September 2010, the FASB issued Concepts Statement 8, "Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting," to replace Concepts Statements 1 and 2.
