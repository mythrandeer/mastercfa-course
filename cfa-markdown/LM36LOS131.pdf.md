NEW YORK, NY (April 24, 2014) - MDC Partners Inc. (NASDAQ: MDCA; TSX: MDZ.A) today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2014.

In general, management may choose to construct non-GAAP financial measures not only to help investors better understand the company's performance but also to paint a more flattering picture of its performance. In some cases, management may attempt to present non-GAAP measures in a way that diverts attention from the standards-compliant financial information that it is required to present.

## ACCOUNTING CHOICES AND ESTIMATES

describe accounting methods (choices and estimates) that could be used to manage earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet items

Management's accounting policies and choices do not necessarily involve complex accounting standards. Something as simple as the shipping terms for goods delivered to customers can have a profound effect on the timing of revenue. On the last day of the first quarter, suppose a company ships USD10,000 of goods to a customer on the terms "free on board (FOB) shipping point," arriving the next day. This shipping term means that the customer takes title to the goods, and bears the risk of loss, at the time the goods leave the seller's loading dock. Barring any issues with collectability
of the receivable, or a likelihood of a return, the seller would be able to recognize revenue on the sale along with the associated profit. That revenue and profit would be recognized in the first quarter of the year. If the point at which the goods' title transfers to the customer is changed to "FOB destination," then the revenue pattern will be completely different. Under these terms, the title-and risk of loss-transfers to the customer when the goods arrive at their destination, which is the customer's address. The seller cannot recognize the sale and profit until the shipment arrives the following day, which is the start of a new accounting period.

A simple change in shipping terms can make the difference between revenue and profits in the reporting period or postponing them until the next period. Shipping terms can also influence management behavior. To "make the numbers," managers might push product out the door prematurely under FOB shipping point arrangements to reflect as much revenue as possible in the reporting period. Alternatively, in the case of an over-abundance of orders, the company could run the risk of exceeding analysts' consensus estimates by a large margin. Management might be uncomfortable with this situation because investors might extrapolate too much from one reporting period in which expectations were exceeded. Management might want to prevent investors from becoming too optimistic and, if possible, delay revenue recognition until the next quarter. This result could be accomplished by fulfilling customer orders by initiating delivery on the last day of the quarter, with shipping terms set as FOB destination. By doing so, title would transfer in the next accounting period. Another possibility in this scenario is that if the customers insisted on FOB shipping point terms, the selling company could simply delay shipment until after the close of the quarter.

This illustration also highlights a difficult distinction for investors to make. A company may use accounting as a tool to aggressively promote earnings growth-as in the example with the premature shipment of goods with FOB shipping point terms-but it may be aggressively managing the business flow by slacking off on shipping goods when business is "too good," as in the second example. In either case, a desired management outcome is obtained by a simple change in shipping terms. Yet, many investors might be inclined to say that the second example is a conservative kind of earnings management and accept it, even though it artificially masks the actual economic activity that occurred at the time.

## How Accounting Choices and Estimates Affect Earnings and Balance Sheets

Assumptions about inventory cost flows provide another example of how accounting choices can affect financial reporting. Companies may assume that their purchases of inventory items are sold to customers on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, with the result that the remaining inventory reflects the most recent costs. Alternatively, they may assume that their purchases of inventory items are sold to customers on a weighted-average cost basis. Example 6 makes the point that merely choosing a cost flow assumption can affect profitability.

## EXAMPLE 6

## Effect of Cost Flow Assumption

A company starts operations with no inventory at the beginning of a fiscal year and makes purchases of a good for resale five times during the period at increasing prices. Each purchase is for the same number of units of the good. The purchases, and the cost of goods available for sale, appear in the following table. Notice that the price per unit has increased by 140 percent by the end of the period.

|  | Units | Price | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Purchase 1 | 5 | USD100 | USD500 |
| Purchase 2 | 5 | 150 | 750 |
| Purchase 3 | 5 | 180 | 900 |
| Purchase 4 | 5 | 200 | 1,000 |
| Purchase 5 | 5 | 240 | 1,200 |
| Cost of goods available for sale |  |  | USD4,350 |

During the period, the company sells, at USD250 each, all of the goods purchased except for five of them. Although the ending inventory consists of five units, the cost attached to those units can vary greatly.

1. What are the ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses the FIFO method of inventory costing?

## Solution:

The ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses the FIFO method of inventory costing are USD1,200 and USD3,150.
2. What are the ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses the weighted-average method of inventory costing?

## Solution:

The ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses the weight-ed-average method of inventory costing are USD870 and USD3,480.
3. Compare cost of goods sold and gross profit calculated under the two methods.

## Solution:

The following table shows how the choice of inventory costing methodsFIFO versus weighted average-affects the cost of goods sold and gross profit.

| Cost Flow Assumption | FIFO | Weighted Average |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cost of goods available for sale | USD4,350 | USD4,350 |
| Ending inventory (5 units) | $(1,200)$ | (870) |
| Cost of goods sold | USD3,150 | USD3,480 |
| Sales | USD5,000 | USD5,000 |
| Cost of goods sold | 3,150 | 3,480 |
| Gross profit | USD1,850 | USD1,520 |
| Gross profit margin | 37.0\% | 30.4\% |

Note: Average inventory cost is calculated as Cost of goods available for sale/Units purchased = $\$ 4,350 / 25=\$ 174$. There are five units in ending inventory, yielding an inventory value of $\$ 870$.

Depending on which cost flow assumption the company uses, the end-of-period inventory is either USD870 (under the weighted-average method) or USD1,200 (under FIFO). The choice of method results in a difference of USD330 in gross profit and 6.6 percent in gross profit margin.

The previous example is simplified and extreme for purposes of illustration clarity, but the point is important: Management's choice among acceptable inventory assumptions and methods affects profit. The selection of an inventory costing method is a policy decision, and companies cannot arbitrarily switch from one method to another. The selection does matter to profitability, however, and it also matters to the balance sheet.

In periods of changing prices, the FIFO cost assumption will provide a more current picture of ending inventory value, because the most recent purchases will remain in inventory. The balance sheet will be more relevant to investors. Under the weighted-average cost assumption, however, the balance sheet will display a blend of old and new costs. During inflationary periods, the value of the inventory will be understated: The company will not be able to replenish its inventory at the value shown. At the same time, the weighted-average inventory cost method ensures that the more current costs are shown in cost of sales, making the income statement more relevant than under the FIFO assumption. Trade-offs exist, and investors should be aware of how accounting choices affect financial reports. High-quality financial reporting provides users with sufficient information to assess the effects of accounting choices.

Estimates abound in financial reporting because of the use of accrual accounting, which attempts to show the effects of all economic events on a company during a particular period. Accrual accounting stands in contrast to cash basis accounting, which shows only the cash transactions conducted by a company. Although a high degree of certainty exists with reporting only cash transactions, much information is hidden. For instance, a company with growing revenues that makes the majority of its sales on credit would be understating its revenues for each period if it reported only cash transactions. On an accrual basis, revenues reflect all transactions that occurred, whether they transacted on a cash basis or credit-extended basis. Estimates enter the process because some facts related to events occurring in a particular period might not yet be known. Estimates can be well grounded in reality and applied to present a complete picture of the events affecting a company, or they can be management tools for achieving a desired financial picture.

To illustrate how estimates can affect financial reporting, consider sales made on credit. A company sells USD1,000,000 of merchandise on credit and records the sale just before year end. Under accrual accounting, that amount is included in revenues and accounts receivable. The company's managers know from experience that they will never collect every dollar of the accounts receivable. Past experience is that, on average, only 97 percent of accounts receivable is collected. The company would estimate an amount of the uncollectible accounts at the time the sales occur and record an uncollectible accounts expense of USD30,000, lowering earnings. The other side of the entry would be to establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts of USD30,000. This allowance would be a contra asset account, presented as an offset to accounts receivable. The accounts receivable, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts, would be stated at USD970,000, which is the amount of cash the company ultimately expects to receive. If cash-basis accounting had been used, no revenues or accounts receivable would have been reported even though sales of merchandise had occurred. Accrual accounting, which contains estimates about future events, provides a much fuller picture of what transpired in the period than pure cash-basis accounting.

Yet, accrual accounting poses temptations to managers to manage the numbers, rather than to manage the business. Suppose a company's managers realize that the company will not meet analysts' consensus estimates in a particular quarter, and further, their bonus pay is dependent on reaching specified earnings targets. By offering special payment terms, or discounts, the managers may induce customers to take delivery of products that they normally would not order, so they could ship the products on FOB shipping point terms and recognize the revenues in the current quarter. They could even be so bold as to ship the goods under those terms even if the customer did
not order them, in the hope that the customer would keep them or, at worst, return them in the next accounting period. Their aim would be to move the product off the company's property with FOB shipping point terms.

To further improve earnings in order to meet the consensus estimates, the company's managers might revise their estimate of the uncollectible accounts. The company's collection history shows a typical non-collection rate of 3 percent of sales, but the managers might rationalize the use of a 2 percent non-collection rate. This change will reduce the allowance for uncollectible accounts and the expense reported for the period. The managers might be able to justify the reduction on the grounds that the sales occurred in a part of the country that was experiencing an improved economic outlook, or that the company's collection history had been biased by the inclusion of a prolonged period of economic downturn. Whatever the justification, it would be hard to prove that the new estimate was completely right or wrong until time had passed. Because proof of the reliability of estimates is rarely available at the time the estimate is recorded, managers have a readily available means for manipulating earnings at their discretion.

ConAgra Foods Inc. provides an example of how the allowance for uncollectible accounts may be manipulated to manage earnings. ${ }^{21}$ A subsidiary, called United Agri-Products (UAP), engaged in several improper accounting practices, one of them being the understatement of uncollectible account expenses for several years. Exhibit 16 presents an excerpt from the SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release.

## Exhibit 16: SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release Regarding United Agri-Products

Generally, UAP's policy required that accounts which were past due between 90 days and one year should be reserved at $50 \%$, and accounts over one year past due were to be reserved at $100 \%$.
... In FY 1999 and continuing through FY 2000, UAP had substantial bad debt problems. In FY 2000, certain former UAP senior executives were informed that UAP needed to record an additional $\$ 50$ million of bad debt expense. Certain former UAP senior executives were aware that in FY 1999 the size of the bad debt at certain IOCs had been substantial enough that it could have negatively impacted those IOC's ability to achieve PBT (profits before taxes) targets. In addition, just prior to the end of UAP's FY 2000, the former UAP COO (chief operating officer), in the presence of other UAP employees, ordered that UAP's bad debt reserve be reduced by $\$ 7$ million in order to assist the Company in meeting its PBT target for the fiscal year.
... At the end of FY 2000, former UAP senior executives reported financial results to ConAgra which they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, overstated UAP's income before income taxes because UAP had failed to record sufficient bad debt expense. The misconduct with respect to bad debt expense caused ConAgra to overstate its reported income before income taxes by \$7 million, or $1.13 \%$, in FY 2000. At the Agricultural Products' segment level, the misconduct caused that segment's reported operating profit to be overstated by $5.05 \%$.

Deferred-tax assets provide a similar example of choices in estimates affecting the earnings outcome. Deferred-tax assets may arise when a company reports a net operating loss under tax accounting rules. A company may record a deferred-tax asset based on the expectation that losses in the reporting period will offset expected future

[^0]profits and reduce the company's future income tax liability. Accounting standards require that the deferred tax asset be reduced by a "valuation allowance" to account for the possibility that the company will not be able to generate enough profit to use all of the available tax benefits. ${ }^{22}$

Assume a company loses EUR1 billion in 2012, generating a net operating loss of the same amount for tax purposes. The company's income tax rate is 25 percent, and it will be able to apply the net operating loss to its taxable income for the next 10 years. The net operating loss results in a deferred tax asset with a nominal value of EUR250 million ( $25 \% \times$ EUR1,000,000,000). Initial recognition would result in a deferred tax asset of EUR250 million and a credit to deferred tax expense of EUR250 million. The company must address the question of whether or not the EUR250 million will ever be completely applied to future income. It may be experiencing increased competition and other circumstances that resulted in the EUR1 billion loss, and it may be unreasonable to assume it will have taxable income against which to apply the loss. In fact, the company's managers might believe it is reasonable to assume only that it will survive for five years, and with marginal profitability. The EUR250 million deferred tax asset is thus overstated if no valuation allowance is recorded to offset it.

The managers believe that only EUR100 million of the net operating losses actually will be applied to the company's taxable income. That belief implies that only EUR25 million of the tax benefits will ever be realized. The deferred tax assets reported on the balance sheet should not exceed this amount. The company should record a valuation allowance of EUR225 million, which would offset the deferred tax asset balance of EUR250 million, resulting in a net deferred tax asset balance of EUR25 million. There also would be a EUR225 million credit to the deferred tax provision. It is important to understand that the valuation allowance should be revised whenever facts and circumstances change.

The ultimate value of the deferred tax asset is driven by management's outlook for the future-and that outlook may be influenced by other factors. If the company needs to stay in compliance with debt covenants and needs every euro of value that can be justified by the outlook, its managers may take a more optimistic view of the future and keep the valuation allowance artificially low (in other words, the net deferred tax asset high).

PowerLinx Inc. provides an example of how over-optimism about the realizability of a deferred tax asset can lead to misstated financial reports. PowerLinx was a maker of security video cameras, underwater cameras, and accessories. Aside from fraudulently reporting 90 percent of its fiscal year 2000 revenue, PowerLinx had problems with valuation of its deferred tax assets. Exhibit 17 provides an excerpt from the SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release with emphasis added. ${ }^{23}$

## Exhibit 17: SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release Regarding PowerLinx

PowerLinx improperly recorded on its fiscal year 2000 balance sheet a deferred tax asset of $\$ 1,439,322$ without any valuation allowance. The tax asset was material, representing almost forty percent of PowerLinx's total assets of \$3,841,944. PowerLinx also recorded deferred tax assets of $\$ 180,613, \$ 72,907$, and $\$ 44,921$, respectively, in its financial statements for the first three quarters of 2000.

[^1]PowerLinx did not have a proper basis for recording the deferred tax assets. The company had accumulated significant losses in 2000 and had no historical operating basis from which to conclude that it would be profitable in future years. Underwater camera sales had declined significantly and the company had devoted most of its resources to developing its SecureView product. The sole basis for PowerLinx's "expectation" of future profitability was the purported \$9 million backlog of SecureView orders, which management assumed would generate taxable income; however, this purported backlog, which predated Bauer's hiring, did not reflect actual demand for SecureView cameras and, consequently, was not a reasonable or reliable indicator of future profitability.

Another example of misstated financial results caused by improper reflection of the realizability of a deferred tax asset occurred with Hampton Roads Bankshares Inc. (HRBS), a commercial bank with deteriorating loan portfolio quality and commensurate losses in the years following the financial crisis. The company reported a deferred tax asset related to its loan losses; however, it did not establish a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset. This decision was based on dubious projections indicating that the company would earn the necessary future taxable income "to fully utilize the [deferred tax asset] DTA over the applicable carry-forward period." ${ }^{24}$ Over time, it became clear that the earnings projections were not realistic, and ultimately the company restated its financial results to include a valuation allowance against almost the entire deferred tax asset. Exhibit 18 presents an excerpt from the company's amended Form 10-Q/A containing the restatement.

## Exhibit 18: Excerpt from Hampton Roads Bankshares, Inc. Form 10-Q/A filed August 13, 2010

## NOTE B - RESTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Subsequent to filing the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and its Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2010 the Company determined that a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets should be recognized as of December 31, 2009. The Company decided to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset because it is uncertain when it will realize this asset.

Accordingly, the December 31, 2009 consolidated balance sheet and the March 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements have been restated to account for this determination. The effect of this change in the consolidated financial statements was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts).

## Consolidated Balance Sheet at 31 March 2010

| Total liabilities and shareholders' equity | 2,975,559 | $(55,983)$ | 2,919,576 |

Another example of how choices and estimates can affect reported results lies in the selection of a depreciation method for allocating the cost of long-lived assets to accounting periods subsequent to their acquisition. A company's managers may choose to depreciate long-lived assets (1) on a straight-line basis, with each year bearing the same amount of depreciation expense; (2) using an accelerated method, with greater depreciation expense recognition in the earlier part of an asset's life; or (3) using an activity-based depreciation method, which allocates depreciation expense based on units of use or production. Depreciation expense is affected by another set of choices and estimates regarding the salvage value of the assets being depreciated. A salvage value of zero will always increase depreciation expense under any method compared with the choice of a non-zero salvage value.

Assume a company invests USD1,000,000 in manufacturing equipment and expects it to have a useful economic life of 10 years. During its expected life, the equipment will produce 400,000 units of product, or USD2.50 depreciation expense per unit produced. When it is disposed of at the end of its expected life, the company's managers expect to realize no value for the equipment. Exhibit 19 shows the differences in the three alternative methods of depreciation: straight-line, accelerated on a double-declining balance basis, and units-of-production method, with no salvage value assumed at the end of the equipment's life.

Exhibit 19: Alternative Methods of Depreciation

| Year | Straight-Line Method | Double-Declining Balance Method |  |  | Units-of-Production Method |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | Depreciation Expense | Balance | Declining Balance Rate | Depreciation Expense | Units Produced | Depreciation Rate/Unit | Depreciation Expense |
| 1 | USD100,000 | USD1,000,000 | 20\% | USD200,000 | 90,000 | USD2.50 | USD225,000 |
| 2 | 100,000 | 800,000 | 20\% | 160,000 | 80,000 | USD2.50 | 200,000 |
| 3 | 100,000 | 640,000 | 20\% | 128,000 | 70,000 | USD2.50 | 175,000 |
| 4 | 100,000 | 512,000 | 20\% | 102,400 | 60,000 | USD2.50 | 150,000 |
| 5 | 100,000 | 409,600 | 20\% | 81,920 | 50,000 | USD2.50 | 125,000 |
| 6 | 100,000 | 327,680 | 20\% | 65,536 | 10,000 | USD2.50 | 25,000 |
| 7 | 100,000 | 262,144 | 20\% | 52,429 | 10,000 | USD2.50 | 25,000 |
| 8 | 100,000 | 209,715 | 20\% | 41,943 | 10,000 | USD2.50 | 25,000 |
| 9 | 100,000 | 167,772 | 20\% | 33,554 | 10,000 | USD2.50 | 25,000 |
| 10 | 100,000 | 134,218 | 20\% | 26,844 | 10,000 | USD2.50 | 25,000 |
| Total | USD1,000,000 |  |  | USD892,626 | 400,000 |  | USD1,000,000 |

The straight-line method allocates the cost of the equipment evenly to all 10 years of the equipment's life. The double-declining balance method will have a higher allocation of cost to the earlier years of the equipment's life. As its name implies, the depreciation expense will decline in each succeeding year because it is based on a fixed rate applied to a declining balance. The rate used was double the straight-line rate, but it could have been any other rate that the company's managers believed was representative of the way the actual equipment depreciation occurred. Notice that the double-declining balance method also results in an incomplete depreciation of the machine at the end of 10 years; a balance of USD107,374 (= USD1,000,000 - USD892,626) remains at the end of the expected life, which will result in a loss upon the retirement of the equipment if the company's expectation of zero salvage value turns out to be correct. Some companies may choose to depreciate the equipment to its expected salvage value, zero in this case, in its final year of use. Some companies may use a policy of switching to straight-line depreciation after the midlife of its depreciable assets in order to fully depreciate them. That particular pattern is coincidentally displayed in the units-of-production example, in which the equipment is used most heavily in the earliest part of its useful life, and then levels off to much less utilization in the second half of the expected life.

Exhibit 20 shows the different expense allocation patterns of the methods over the same life. Each will affect earnings differently.

Exhibit 20: Expense Allocation Patterns of Different Depreciation Methods

The company's managers could justify any of these methods. Each might fairly represent the way the equipment will be consumed over its expected economic life, which is a subjective estimate. The choices of methods and lives can profoundly affect reported income. These choices are not proven right or wrong until far into the future-but managers must estimate their effects in the present.

Exhibit 21 shows the effects of the three different methods on operating profit and operating profit margins, assuming that the production output of the equipment generates revenues of USD500,000 each year and USD200,000 of cash operating expenses are incurred, leaving USD300,000 of operating profit before depreciation expense.

*Includes \$107,374 of undepreciated basis, treated as depreciation expense in final year of service.
The straight-line method shows consistent operating profit margins, and the other two methods show varying degrees of increasing operating profit margins as the depreciation expense decreases over time.

Exhibit 21 shows the differences among alternative methods, but even more depreciation expense variation is possible by changing estimated lives and assumptions about salvage value. For instance, change the expected life assumption to 5 years from 10 and add an expectation that the equipment will have a 10 percent salvage value at the end of its expected life. Exhibit 22 shows the revised depreciation calculations. Notice that under the double-declining balance method, the depreciation rate is applied to the gross cost, unlike the other two methods. The straight-line method and the units-of-production method subtract the salvage value from the cost before depreciation expense is calculated. Also note that the assumption about the usage of the equipment is revised so that it is depreciated only to its salvage value of USD100,000 by the end of its estimated life. The total depreciation under each method is USD900,000.

[^3]Exhibit 23 shows the different expense allocation patterns of the methods over the five-year expected life, and assuming a 10 percent salvage value. Although each method is distinctly different in the timing of the cost allocation over time, the variation is less pronounced than over the longer life used in the previous example.

One of the clearest examples of how choices affect both the balance sheet and income statement can be found in capitalization practices. In classifying a payment made, management must determine whether the payment will benefit only the current period-making it an expense-or whether it will benefit future periods, leading to classification as a cost to be capitalized as an asset. This management judgment embodies an implicit forecast of how the item acquired by the payment will be used, or not used, in the future.

That judgment can be biased by the powerful effect a capitalization policy can have on earnings. Every amount capitalized on the balance sheet as a building, an item of inventory, a deferred cost, or any "other asset" is an amount that has not been recognized as an expense in the reporting period.

A real-life example can be found in the case of WorldCom Inc., a telecom concern that grew rapidly in the late 1990s. Much of WorldCom's financial reporting was eventually found to be fraudulent. An important part of the misreporting centered on its treatment of what is known in the telecom industry as "line costs." These are the costs of carrying a voice call or data transmission from its starting point to its ending point, and they represented WorldCom's largest expense. WorldCom's CFO decided to capitalize such costs instead of treating them as an operating expense. As a consequence, from the second quarter of 1999 through the first quarter of 2002, WorldCom increased its operating income by USD7 billion. In three of the five quarters in which the improper line cost capitalization took place, WorldCom would have recognized pre-tax losses instead of profits. ${ }^{25}$

Similarly, acquisitions are an area in which managers must exercise judgment. An allocation of the purchase price must be made to all of the different assets acquired based on their fair values, and those fair values are not always objectively verifiable. Management may have to make its own estimate of fair values for assets acquired, and it may be biased toward a low estimate for the values of depreciable assets in order to depress future depreciation expense. Another benefit to keeping depreciable asset values low is that the amount of the purchase price that cannot be allocated to specific assets is classified as goodwill, which is neither depreciated nor amortized in future reporting periods.

25 See Report of Investigation by the Special Investigative Committee of the Board of Directors of WorldCom, Inc., by Dennis R. Beresford, Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, and C.B. Rogers, Jr., (31 March 2003), pages 9-11, www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723527/000093176303001862/dex991.htm.

Goodwill reporting has choices of its own. Although goodwill has no effect on future earnings when unimpaired, annual testing of its fair value may reveal that the excess of price paid over the fair value of assets may not be recoverable, which should lead to a write-down of goodwill. The estimation process for the fair value of goodwill may depend heavily on projections of future performance. Those projections may be biased upward to avoid a goodwill write-down.

## ACCOUNTING CHOICES THAT AFFECT THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT

describe accounting methods (choices and estimates) that could be used to manage earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet items

The cash flow statement consists of three sections: the operating section, which shows the cash generated or used by operations; the investing section, which shows cash used for investments or provided by their disposal; and the financing section, which shows transactions attributable to financing activities.

The operating section is closely scrutinized by investors. Many of them consider it a reality check on reported earnings, on the grounds that earnings attributable to accrual accounting only and unsupported by actual cash flows may indicate earnings manipulation. Such investors believe that amounts shown for cash generated by operations is more insulated from managerial manipulation than the income statement. Cash generated by operations can be managed to an extent, however.

The operating section of the cash flow statement can be shown either under the direct method or the indirect method. Under the direct method, "entities are encouraged to report major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments and their arithmetic sum-the net cash flow from operating activities." ${ }^{26}$ In practice, companies rarely use the direct method. Instead, they use the indirect method, which shows a reconciliation of net income to cash provided by operations. The reconciliation shows the non-cash items affecting net income along with changes in working capital accounts affecting cash from operations. Exhibit 24 provides an example of the indirect presentation method.

Exhibit 24: Indirect Presentation Method

| Cash Flows from Operating Activities (USD millions) | 2018 |
| :--- | :--- |
| Net income | USD3,000 |
| Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: |  |
| Provision for doubtful receivables | 10 |
| Provision for depreciation and amortization | 1,000 |
| Goodwill impairment charges | 35 |
| Share-based compensation expense | 100 |

26 Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), Section 230-10-45-25, Reporting Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities. The direct method and indirect method are similar in IFRS, as addressed in IAS 7, Paragraph 18.

| Cash Flows from Operating Activities (USD millions) | 2018 |
| :--- | :--- |
| Provision for deferred income taxes | 200 |
| Changes in assets and liabilities: |  |
| Trade, notes, and financing receivables related to sales | $(2,000)$ |
| Inventories | $(1,500)$ |
| Accounts payable | 1,200 |
| Accrued income taxes payable/receivable | (80) |
| Retirement benefits | 90 |
| Other | (250) |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | USD1,805 |

Whether the indirect method or direct method is used, simple choices exist for managers to improve the appearance of cash flow provided by operations without actually improving it. One such choice is in the area of accounts payable management, shaded in Exhibit 24. Assume that the accounts payable balance is USD5,200 million at the end of the period, an increase of USD1,200 million from its previous year-end balance of USD4,000 million. The USD1,200 million increase in accounts payable matched increased expenses or assets but did not require cash. If the company's managers had further delayed paying creditors USD500 million until the day after the balance sheet date, they could have increased the cash provided by operating activities by USD500 million. If the managers believe that cash generated from operations is a metric of focus for investors, they can impress them with artificially strong cash flow by simply stretching the accounts payable credit period.

What might alert investors to such machinations? They need to examine the composition of the operations section of the cash flow statement-if they do not, then nothing will ever alert them. Studying changes in the working capital can reveal unusual patterns that may indicate manipulation of the cash provided by operations.

Another practice that might lead an investor to question the quality of cash provided by operations is to compare a company's cash generation with an industry-wide level or with the cash operating performance of one or more similar competitors. Cash generation performance can be measured several ways. One way is to compare the relationship between cash generated by operations and net income. Cash generated by operations in excess of net income signifies better quality of earnings, whereas a chronic excess of net income over cash generated by operations should be a cause for concern; it may signal the use of accounting methods to simply raise net income instead of depicting financial reality. Another way to measure cash generation performance is to compare cash generated by operations with debt service, capital expenditures, and dividends (if any). When there is a wide variance between the company's cash generation performance and that of its benchmarks, investors should seek an explanation and carefully examine the changes in working capital accounts.

Because investors may focus on cash from operations as an important metric, managers may resort to managing the working capital accounts as described in order to present the most favorable picture. But this can be done in other ways. A company may misclassify operating uses of cash into either the investing or financing sections of the cash flow statement, which enhances the appearance of cash generated by operating activities.

Dynegy Inc. provides an example of manipulation of cash from operations through clever construction of contracts and assistance from an unconsolidated special purpose entity named ABG Gas Supply LLC (ABG). In April 2001, Dynegy entered into a contract for the purchase of natural gas from ABG. According to the contract, Dynegy would purchase gas at below-market rates from ABG for nine months and sell it at the current market rate. The nine-month term coincided with Dynegy's 2001
year-end and would result in gains backed by cash flows. Dynegy also agreed to buy gas at above-market rates from ABG for the following 51 months and sell it at the current market rate. The contract was reported at its fair value at the end of fiscal year 2001. It had no effect on net income for the year. The earlier portion of the contract resulted in a gain, supported by USD300 million of cash flow, but the latter portion of the contract resulted in non-cash losses that offset the profit. The mark-to-market rules required the recognition of both gains and losses from all parts of the contract, and hence the net effect on earnings was zero.

In April 2002, a Wall Street Journal article exposed the chicanery, thanks to leaked documents. The SEC required Dynegy to restate the cash flow statement by reclassifying USD300 million from the operating section of the cash flow statement to the financing section, on the grounds that Dynegy had used ABG as a conduit to effectively borrow USD300 million from Citigroup. The bank had extended credit to ABG, which it used to finance its losses on the contract (Lee, 2012).

Another area of flexibility in cash flow reporting is found in the area of interest capitalization, which creates differences between total interest payments and total interest costs. ${ }^{27}$ Assume a company incurs total interest cost of USD30,000, composed of USD3,000 of discount amortization and USD27,000 of interest payments. Of the USD30,000, two-thirds of it (USD20,000) is expensed; the remaining third (USD10,000) is capitalized as plant assets. If the company uses the same interest expense/capitalization proportions to allocate the interest payments between operating and investing activities, then it will report USD18,000 ( $2 / 3 \times$ USD27,000) as an operating outflow and USD9,000 ( $1 / 3 \times$ USD27,000) as an investing outflow. The company might also choose to offset the entire USD3,000 of non-cash discount amortization against the USD20,000 treated as expense, resulting in an operating outflow as low as USD17,000, or as much as USD20,000 if it allocated all of the non-cash discount amortization to interest capitalized as investing activities. Similarly, the investing outflow could be as much as USD10,000 or as little as USD7,000, depending on the treatment of the non-cash discount amortization. There are choices within the choices, all in areas in which investors believe choices do not even exist. Nurnberg and Largay (1998) have noted that companies apparently favor the method that reports the lowest operating outflow, presumably to maximize reported cash from operations.

Investors and analysts need to be aware that presentation choices permitted in IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows, offer flexibility in classification of certain items in the cash flow statement. This flexibility can drastically change the results in the operating section of the cash flow statement. An excerpt from IAS 7, Paragraphs 33 and 34, provides the background:
33. Interest paid and interest and dividends received are usually classified as operating cash flows for a financial institution. However, there is no consensus on the classification of these cash flows for other entities. Interest paid and interest and dividends received may be classified as operating cash flows because they enter into the determination of profit or loss. Alternatively, interest paid and interest and dividends received may be classified as financing cash flows and investing cash flows respectively, because they are costs of obtaining financial resources or returns on investments.
34. Dividends paid may be classified as a financing cash flow because they are a cost of obtaining financial resources. Alternatively, dividends paid may be classified as a component of cash flows from operating activities in order to assist users to determine the ability of an entity to pay dividends out of operating cash flows. [Emphasis added.]

[^4]By allowing a choice of operating or financing for the placement of interest and dividends received or paid, IAS 7 gives a company's managers the opportunities to select the presentation that gives the best-looking picture of operating performance. An example is Norse Energy Corp. ASA, a Norwegian gas explorer and producer, which changed its classifications of interest paid and interest received in 2007 (Gordon, Henry, Jorgensen, and Linthicum, 2017). Interest paid was switched to financing instead of decreasing cash generated from operations. Norse Energy also switched its classification of interest received to investing from operating cash flow. The net effect of these changes was to report positive, rather than negative, operating cash flows in both 2007 and 2008. With these simple changes, the company could also change the perception of its operations. The cash flow statement formerly presented the appearance of a company with operations that used more cash than it generated, and it possibly raised questions about the sustainability of operations. After the revision, the operating section of the cash flow statement depicted a much more viable operation.

Exhibit 25 shows the net effect of the reclassifications on Norse Energy's cash flows.

Exhibit 25: Reclassification of Cash Flows (amounts in USD millions)

|  | As Reported (following 2007 reclassification) |  | Adjustments (without reclassification*) |  | Pro forma (without reclassification) |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | 2008 | 2007 | 2008 | 2007 | 2008 | 2007 |
| Operating | USD5.30 | USD2.80 | (USD13.70) | (USD14.40) | (USD8.40) | (USD11.60) |
| Investing | USD0.90 | (USD56.80) | (USD9.00) | (USD3.50) | (USD8.10) | (USD60.30) |
| Financing | (USD16.60) | USD34.50 | USD22.70 | USD17.90 | USD6.10 | USD52.40 |
| Total | (USD10.40) | (USD19.50) | USD0 | USD0 | (USD10.40) | (USD19.50) |

* The adjustments reverse the addition of interest received to investing and instead add it to operating. The adjustments also reverse the deduction of interest paid from financing and instead subtract it from operating. REPORTING

Exhibit 26 summarizes some of the areas in which choices can be made that affect financial reports.

## Exhibit 26: Areas in Which Choices and Estimates Affect Financial Reporting

| Area of Choice/Estimate | Analyst Concerns |
| :--- | :--- |
| Revenue recognition | - How is revenue recognized: upon shipment or upon delivery | of goods?

- Is the company engaging in "channel stuffing"-the practice of overloading a distribution channel with more product than it is normally capable of selling? This can be accomplished by inducing customers to buy more through unusual discounts, the threat of near-term price increases, or both-or simply by shipping goods that were not ordered. These transactions may be corrected in a subsequent period and may result in restated results. Are accounts receivable relative to revenues abnormally high for relative to the company's history or to its peers? If so, channel stuffing may have occurred.
- Is there unusual activity in the allowance for sales returns relative to past history?
- Does the company's days sales outstanding show any collection issues that might indicate shipment of unneeded or unwanted goods to customers?
- Does the company engage in "bill-and-hold" transactions? This is when a customer purchases goods but requests that they remain with the seller until a later date. This kind of transaction makes it possible for a seller to manufacture fictitious sales by declaring end-of-period inventory as "sold but held," with a minimum of effort and phony documentation.
- Does the company use rebates as part of its marketing approach? If so, how significantly do the estimates of rebate fulfillment affect net revenues, and have any unusual breaks with history occurred?
- Does the company separate its revenue arrangements into multiple deliverables of goods or services? This area is one of great revenue recognition flexibility and also is one that provides little visibility to investors. They simply cannot examine a company's arrangements and decide for themselves whether or not revenue has been properly allocated to different components of a contract. If a company uses multiple deliverable arrangements with its customers as a routine matter, investors might be more sensitive to revenue reporting risks. In seeking a comfort level, they might ask the following questions: Does the company explain adequately how it determines the different allocations of deliverables and how revenue is recognized on each one? Do deferred revenues result? If not, does it seem reasonable that there are no deferred revenues for this kind of arrangement? Are there unusual trends in revenues and receivables, particularly with regard to cash conversion? If an investor is not satisfied with the answers to these questions, he or she might be more comfortable with other investment choices.

| Area of Choice/Estimate | Analyst Concerns |
| :--- | :--- |
| Long-lived assets: <br> Depreciation policies | - Do the estimated life spans of the associated assets make sense, or are they unusually low compared with others in the same industry? <br> - Have there been changes in depreciable lives that have a positive effect on current earnings? <br> - Do recent asset write-downs indicate that company policy on asset lives might need to be reconsidered? |
| Intangibles: Capitalization policies | - Does the company capitalize expenditures related to intangibles, such as software? Does its balance sheet show any R\&D capitalized as a result of acquisitions? Or, if the company is an IFRS filer, has it capitalized any internally generated development costs? <br> - How do the company's capitalization policies compare with the competition? <br> - Are amortization policies reasonable? |
| Allowance for doubtful accounts/loan loss reserves | - Are additions to such allowances lower or higher than in the past? <br> - Does the collection experience justify any difference from historical provisioning? <br> - Is there a possibility that any lowering of the allowance may be the result of industry difficulties along with the difficulty of meeting earnings expectations? |
| Inventory cost methods | - Does the company use a costing method that produces fair reporting results in view of its environment? How do its inventory methods compare with others in its industry? Are there differences that will make comparisons uneven if there are unusual changes in inflation? <br> - Does the company use reserves for obsolescence in its inventory valuation? If so, are they subject to unusual fluctuations that might indicate adjusting them to arrive at a specified earnings result? <br> - If a company reports under US GAAP and uses last-in, firstout (LIFO) inventory accounting, does LIFO liquidation (the assumed sale of old, lower-cost layers of inventory) occur through inventory reduction programs? This inventory reduction may generate earnings without supporting cash flow, and management may intentionally reduce the layers to produce specific earnings benefits. |


| Area of Choice/Estimate | Analyst Concerns |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tax asset valuation accounts | - Tax assets, if present, must be stated at the value at which management expects to realize them, and an allowance must be set up to restate tax assets to the level expected to eventually be converted into cash. Determining the allowance involves an estimate of future operations and tax payments. Does the amount of the valuation allowance seem reasonable, overly optimistic, or overly pessimistic? <br> - Are there contradictions between the management commentary and the allowance level, or the tax note and the allowance level? There cannot be an optimistic management commentary and a fully reserved tax asset, or vice versa. One of them has to be wrong. <br> - Look for changes in the tax asset valuation account. It may be 100 percent reserved at first, and then "optimism" increases whenever an earnings boost is needed. Lowering the reserve decreases tax expense and increases net income. |
| Goodwill | - Companies must annually assess goodwill balances for impairment on a qualitative basis. If further testing appears necessary, it is based on estimates of the fair value of the reporting units (US GAAP issuers), or cash-generating units (IFRS issuers), associated with goodwill balances. The tests are based on subjective estimates, including future cash flows and the employment of discount rates. <br> - Do the disclosures on goodwill testing suggest that the exercise was skewed to avoid impairment charges? |
| Warranty reserves | - Have additions to the reserves been reduced, perhaps to make earnings targets? Examine the trend in the charges of actual costs against the reserves: Do they support or contradict the warranty provisioning activity? Do the actual costs charged against the reserve give the analyst any indication about the quality of the products sold? |
| Related-party transactions | - Is the company engaged in transactions that disproportionately benefit members of management? Does one company have control over another's destiny through supply contracts or other dealings? <br> - Do extensive dealings take place with non-public companies that are under management control? If so, those companies could absorb losses (e.g., through supply arrangements that are unfavorable to them) to make the public company's performance look good. This scenario may provide opportunities for an owner to cash out. |

The most important lesson is that choices exist among accounting methods and estimates, and an analyst needs a working knowledge of these options to understand whether management may have made choices to achieve a desired result.
