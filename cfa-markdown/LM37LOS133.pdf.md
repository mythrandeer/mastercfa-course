- Graphs facilitate comparison of performance and financial structure over time, provide a visual overview of changes and trends, and can be used to communicate the conclusions from financial analysis. Regression analysis can help identify relationships or correlation between variables.
- Activity ratios measure the efficiency of a company's operations, such as a collection of receivables or management of inventory. Major activity ratios include inventory turnover, days of inventory on hand, receivables turnover, days of sales outstanding, payables turnover, number of days of payables, working capital turnover, fixed asset turnover, and total asset turnover.
- Liquidity ratios measure the ability of a company to meet short-term obligations. Major liquidity ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, and defensive interval ratio. The cash conversion cycle is a measure of liquidity that is not a simple ratio.
- Solvency ratios measure the ability of a company to meet long-term obligations. Major solvency ratios include debt ratios (including the debt-to-assets ratio, debt-to-capital ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and financial leverage ratio) and coverage ratios (including interest coverage and fixed charge coverage).
- Profitability ratios measure the ability of a company to generate profits from revenue and assets. Major profitability ratios include return on sales ratios (including gross profit margin, operating profit margin, pretax margin, and net profit margin) and return on investment ratios (including operating return on assets [ROA], ROA, return on total capital, return on equity [ROE], and return on common equity).
- It is important to examine a variety of financial ratios-not a single ratio or category of ratios in isolation-to ascertain the overall position and performance of a company.
- DuPont analysis breaks ROE into components that are indicators of different aspects of company performance. Many levels of decomposition are possible.
- The five-component DuPont decomposition expresses a company's ROE as a function of its tax rate, interest burden, operating profitability, efficiency, and leverage.
- Because aspects of performance that are considered important in one industry may be irrelevant in another, industry-specific ratios are used that reflect these differences.
- Techniques such as sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and simulation are used to forecast future financial performance.


## THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS PROCESS

describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis, including their uses and limitations

In financial analysis, it is essential to clearly identify and understand the final objective and the steps required to reach that objective. In addition, the analyst needs to know where to find relevant data, how to process and analyze the data (in other words, know the typical questions to address when interpreting data), and how to communicate the analysis and conclusions.

## The Objectives of the Financial Analysis Process

Because of the variety of reasons for performing financial analysis, the numerous available techniques, and the often substantial amount of data, it is important that the analytical approach be tailored to the specific situation. Prior to beginning any financial analysis, the analyst should clarify the purpose and context, and clearly understand the following:

- What is the purpose of the analysis? What questions will this analysis answer?
- What level of detail will be needed to accomplish this purpose?
- What data are available for the analysis?
- What are the factors or relationships that will influence the analysis?
- What are the analytical limitations, and will these limitations potentially impair the analysis?

Having clarified the purpose and context of the analysis, the analyst can select the set of techniques (e.g., ratios) that will best assist in making a decision. Although there is no single approach to structuring the analysis process, a general framework is set forth in Exhibit 1. The steps in this process were discussed in more detail in an earlier module; the primary focus of this module is on Phases 3 and 4, processing and analyzing data.

Exhibit 1: A Financial Statement Analysis Framework

| Phase |  | Sources of Information | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | Articulate the purpose and context of the analysis. | - The nature of the analyst's function, such as evaluating an equity or debt investment or issuing a credit rating. <br> - Communication with client or supervisor on needs and concerns. <br> - Institutional guidelines related to developing specific work product. | - Statement of the purpose or objective of analysis. <br> - A list (written or unwritten) of specific questions to be answered by the analysis. <br> - Nature and content of report to be provided. <br> - Timetable and budgeted resources for completion. |
| 2. | Collect input data. | - Financial statements, other financial data, questionnaires, and industry/ economic data. <br> - Discussions with management, suppliers, customers, and competitors. <br> - Company site visits (e.g., to production facilities or retail stores). | - Organized financial statements. <br> - Financial data tables. <br> - Completed questionnaires, if applicable. |

| 6. | Follow-up. | - Information gathered by periodically repeating above steps as necessary to determine whether changes to holdings or recommendations are necessary. | - Updated reports and recommendations. |

## Distinguishing between Computations and Analysis

An effective analysis encompasses both computations and interpretations. A well-reasoned analysis differs from a mere compilation of various pieces of information, computations, tables, and graphs by integrating the data collected into a cohesive whole. Analysis of past performance, for example, should address not only what happened but also why it happened and whether it created value. Some of the key questions to address include the following:

- What aspects of performance are critical for this company to successfully compete in this industry?
- How well did the company's performance meet these critical aspects? (Established through computation and comparison with appropriate benchmarks, such as the company's own historical performance or competitors' performance.)
- What were the key causes of this performance, and how does this performance reflect the company's strategy? (Established through analysis.)

If the analysis is forward looking, additional questions include the following:

- What is the likely impact of an event or trend? (Established through interpretation of analysis.)
- What is the likely response of management to this trend? (Established through evaluation of quality of management and corporate governance.)
- What is the likely impact of trends in the company, industry, and economy on future cash flows? (Established through assessment of corporate strategy and through forecasts.)
- What are the recommendations of the analyst? (Established through interpretation and forecasting of results of analysis.)
- What risks should be highlighted? (Established by an evaluation of major uncertainties in the forecast and in the environment within which the company operates.)

Example 1 demonstrates how a company's financial data can be analyzed in the context of its business strategy and changes in that strategy. An analyst must be able to understand the "why" behind the numbers and ratios, not just what the numbers and ratios are.

## EXAMPLE 1

## Strategy Reflected in Financial Performance

Apple Inc. engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer hardware, mobile devices, operating systems and related products, and services. It also operates retail and online stores. Microsoft develops, licenses, and supports software products, services, and technology devices through a variety of channels including retail stores in recent years. Selected financial data for 2015 through 2017 for these two companies are given in Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3. Apple's fiscal year (FY) ends on the final Saturday in September (for example, FY2017 ended on 30 September 2017). Microsoft's fiscal year ends on 30 June (for example, FY2017 ended on 30 June 2017).

Exhibit 2: Selected Financial Data for Apple (US dollar millions)

| Fiscal year | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Net sales (or Revenue) | 229,234 | 215,639 | 233,715 |
| Gross margin | 88,186 | 84,263 | 93,626 |
| Operating income | 61,344 | 60,024 | 71,230 |

Exhibit 3: Selected Financial Data for Microsoft (US dollar millions)*

| Fiscal year | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Net sales (or revenue) | 89,950 | 85,320 | 93,580 |
| Gross margin | 55,689 | 52,540 | 60,542 |
| Operating income | 22,326 | 20,182 | 18,161 |

* Microsoft revenue for 2017 and 2016 were subsequently revised in the company's 2018 10-K report due to changes in revenue recognition and lease accounting standards.

Source: 10-K reports for Apple and Microsoft.
Apple reported a 7.7 percent decrease in net sales from FY2015 to FY2016 and an increase of 6.3 percent from FY2016 to FY2017 for an overall slight decline over the three-year period. Gross margin decreased 10.0 percent from FY2015 to FY2016 and increased 4.7 percent from FY2016 to FY2017. This also represented an overall decline in gross margin over the three-year period. The company's operating income exhibited similar trends.

Microsoft reported an 8.8 percent decrease in net sales from FY2015 to FY2016 and an increase of 5.4 percent from FY2016 to FY2017 for an overall slight decline over the three-year period. Gross margin decreased 13.2 percent from FY2015 to FY2016 and increased 6.0 percent from FY2016 to FY2017. Similar to Apple, this represented an overall decline in gross margin over the
three-year period. Microsoft's operating income, in contrast, exhibited growth each year and for the three-year period. Overall growth in operating income was 23 percent.

What caused Microsoft's growth in operating income while Apple and Microsoft had similar negative trends in sales and gross margin? Apple's decline in sales, gross margin, and operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 was caused by declines in iPhone sales and weakness in foreign currencies relative to the US dollar. FY2017 saw a rebound in sales of iPhones, Mac computers, and services offset somewhat by continued weaknesses in foreign currencies. Microsoft similarly had declines in revenue and gross margin from sales of its devices and Windows software in FY2016, as well as negative impacts from foreign currency weakness. Microsoft's increase in revenue and gross margin in FY2017 was driven by the acquisition of LinkedIn, higher sales of Microsoft Office software, and higher sales of cloud services. The driver in the continuous increase in operating income for Microsoft was a large decline over the threeyear period in impairment, integration, and restructuring charges. Microsoft recorded a USD10 billion charge in FY2015 related to its phone business, and there were further charges of USD1.1 billion in FY2016 and USD306 million in FY2017. Absent these large write-offs, Microsoft would have had a trend similar to Apple's in operating income over the three-year period.

Analysts often need to communicate the findings of their analysis in a written report. Their reports should communicate how conclusions were reached and why recommendations were made. For example, a report might present the following:

- the purpose of the report, unless it is readily apparent;
- relevant aspects of the business context, including:
- economic environment (country/region, macro economy, sector),
- financial and other infrastructure (accounting, auditing, rating agencies), and
- legal and regulatory environment (and any other material limitations on the company being analyzed);
- evaluation of corporate governance and assessment of management strategy, including the company's competitive advantage(s);
- assessment of financial and operational data, including key assumptions in the analysis; and
- conclusions and recommendations, including limitations of the analysis and risks.

An effective narrative and well supported conclusions and recommendations are normally enhanced by using 3-10 years of data as well as by analytic techniques appropriate to the purpose of the report.

## ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis, including their uses and limitations

The tools and techniques presented in this lesson facilitate evaluations of company data. Evaluations require comparisons. It is difficult to say that a company's financial performance was "good" or "bad" without clarifying the basis for comparison. In assessing a company's ability to generate and grow earnings and cash flow, and the risks related to those earnings and cash flows, the analyst draws comparisons to other companies at the same point in time or over the same range of time (cross-sectional analysis) and over time (trend or time-series analysis).

For example, an analyst may wish to compare the profitability of companies competing in a global industry. If the companies differ significantly in size or report their financial data in different currencies, comparing net income as reported is not useful. Ratios (which express one number in relation to another) and common-size financial statements can remove size as a factor and enable a more relevant comparison. To achieve comparability across companies reporting in different currencies, one approach is to translate all reported numbers into a common currency using average or period-end exchange rates. Alternatively, if the focus is primarily on ratios, comparability can be achieved without translating the currencies.

The analyst may also want to examine comparable performance over time. Again, the nominal currency amounts of sales or net income may not highlight significant changes. To address this challenge, horizontal financial statements (whereby quantities are stated in terms of a selected base year value) can make such changes more apparent. Another obstacle to comparison is differences in fiscal year end. To achieve comparability, one approach is to develop trailing 12 months of data. Finally, it should be noted that differences in accounting standards can limit comparability.

## EXAMPLE 2

## Ratio Analysis

An analyst is examining the profitability of two international companies with large shares of the global personal computer market: Acer Inc. and Lenovo Group Limited. Acer has pursued a strategy of selling its products at affordable prices. In contrast, Lenovo aims to achieve higher selling prices by stressing the high engineering quality of its personal computers for business use. Acer reports in New Taiwan dollars (TWD) and Lenovo reports in US dollars (USD). For Acer, fiscal year end is 31 December. For Lenovo, fiscal year end is 31 March; thus, FY2017 ended 31 March 2018.

The analyst collects the data shown in Exhibit 4. Use this information to answer the following questions:

Exhibit 4: Acer versus Lenova Profitability
Acer

| TWD Millions | FY2013 | FY2014 | FY2015 | FY2016 | FY2017 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 360,132 | 329,684 | 263,775 | 232,724 | 237,275 |
| Gross profit | 22,550 | 28,942 | 24,884 | 23,212 | 25,361 |
| Net income | $(20,519)$ | 1,791 | 604 | $(4,901)$ | 2,797 |


| Lenovo |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| USD Millions | FY2013 | FY2014 | FY2015 | FY2016 | FY2017 |
| Revenue | 38,707 | 46,296 | 44,912 | 43,035 | 45,350 |
| Gross profit | 5,064 | 6,682 | 6,624 | 6,105 | 6,272 |
| Net income (Loss) | 817 | 837 | (145) | 530 | (127) |

Note: Fiscal years for Lenovo end 31 March. Thus, FY2017 represents the fiscal year ended 31 March 2018; the same applies respectively for prior years.

1. Which company is larger based on the amount of revenue, in US dollars, reported in fiscal year 2017? For FY2017, assume the relevant, average exchange rate was 30.95 TWD/USD.
Solution:
Lenovo is much larger than Acer based on FY2017 revenues in US dollar terms. Lenovo's FY2017 revenues of USD45.35 billion are considerably higher than Acer's USD7. 67 billion (= TWD237.275 million/30.95).
Acer: At the assumed average exchange rate of 30.95 TWD/USD, Acer's FY2017 revenues are equivalent to USD7.67 billion (= TWD237.275 million $\div 30.95$ TWD/USD).
Lenovo: Lenovo's FY2017 revenues totaled USD45.35 billion.
Note: Comparing the size of companies reporting in different currencies requires translating reported numbers into a common currency using exchange rates at some point in time. This solution converts the revenues of Acer to billions of US dollars using the average exchange rate of the fiscal period. It would be equally informative (and would yield the same conclusion) to convert the revenues of Lenovo to New Taiwan dollars.
2. Which company had the higher revenue growth from FY2016 to FY2017? FY2013 to FY2017?
Solution:
The growth in Lenovo's revenue was much higher than Acer's in the most recent fiscal year and for the five-year period.

|  | Change in Revenue FY2016 versus FY2017 (\%) | Change in Revenue FY2013 to FY2017 (\%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Acer | 1.96 | (34.11) |
| Lenovo | 5.38 | 17.16 |

The table shows two growth metrics. Calculations are illustrated using the revenue data for Acer:

The change in Acer's revenue for FY2016 versus FY2017 is 1.96 percent calculated as $(237,275-232,724) \div 232,724$ or equivalently $(237,275 \div 232,724)$ - 1. The change in Acer's revenue from FY2013 to FY2017 is a decline of 34.11 percent.
3. How do the companies compare, based on profitability?

## Solution:

Profitability can be assessed by comparing the amount of gross profit to revenue and the amount of net income to revenue. The following table presents these two profitability ratios-gross profit margin (gross profit divided by revenue) and net profit margin (net income divided by revenue)-for each year.

| Acer | FY2013 (\%) | FY2014 (\%) | FY2015 (\%) | FY2016 (\%) | FY2017 (\%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gross profit margin | 6.26 | 8.78 | 9.43 | 9.97 | 10.69 |
| Net profit margin | (5.70) | 0.54 | 0.23 | (2.11) | 1.18 |


| Lenovo | FY2013 (\%) | FY2014 (\%) | FY2015 (\%) | FY2016 (\%) | FY2017 (\%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gross profit margin | 13.08 | 14.43 | 14.75 | 14.19 | 13.83 |
| Net profit margin | 2.11 | 1.81 | (0.32) | 1.23 | (0.28) |

The net profit margins indicate that both companies' profitability is relatively low. Acer's net profit margin is lower than Lenovo's in three out of the five years. Acer's gross profit margin increased each year but remains significantly below that of Lenovo. Lenovo's gross profit margin grew from FY2013 to FY2015 and then declined in FY2016 and FY2017. Overall, Lenovo is the more profitable company, likely attributable to its larger size and commensurate economies of scale. (Lenovo has the largest share of the personal computer market relative to other personal computer companies.)

## 4 FINANCIAL RATIO ANALYSIS

\end{array}

$$

There are many relationships among financial accounts and various expected relationships from one point in time to another. Ratios are a useful way of expressing these relationships. Ratios express one quantity in relation to another, usually as a quotient.

Extensive academic research has examined the importance of ratios in predicting stock returns (Ou and Penman, 1989; Abarbanell and Bushee, 1998) or credit failure (Altman, 1968; Ohlson, 1980; Hopwood et al., 1994). This research has found that
financial statement ratios are effective in selecting investments and in predicting financial distress. Practitioners routinely use ratios to derive and communicate the value of companies and securities.

Several aspects of ratio analysis are important to understand. First, the computed ratio is not "the answer." The ratio is an indicator of some aspect of a company's performance, telling what happened but not why it happened. For example, an analyst might want to answer the question: Which of two companies was more profitable? As demonstrated in the previous example, the net profit margin, which expresses profit relative to revenue, can provide insight into this question. Net profit margin is calculated by dividing net income by revenue:

Net income
Revenue -
Assume Company A has EUR100,000 of net income and Company B has EUR200,000 of net income. Company B generated twice as much income as Company A, but was it more profitable? Assume further that Company A has EUR2,000,000 of revenue, and thus a net profit margin of 5 percent, and Company B has EUR6,000,000 of revenue, and thus a net profit margin of 3.33 percent. Expressing net income as a percentage of revenue clarifies the relationship: For each EUR100 of revenue, Company A earns EUR5 in net income, whereas Company B earns only EUR3.33 for each EUR100 of revenue. So, we can now answer the question of which company was more profitable in percentage terms: Company A was more profitable, as indicated by its higher net profit margin of 5 percent. Note that Company A was more profitable despite the fact that Company B reported higher absolute amounts of net income and revenue. However, this ratio by itself does not tell us why Company A has a higher profit margin. Further analysis is required to determine the reason (perhaps higher relative sales prices or better cost control or lower effective tax rates).

Company size sometimes confers economies of scale, so the absolute amounts of net income and revenue are useful in financial analysis. However, ratios control for the effect of size, which enhances comparisons between companies and over time.

A second important aspect of ratio analysis is that differences in accounting policies (across companies and across time) can distort ratios, and a meaningful comparison, therefore, may involve adjustments to the financial data. Third, not all ratios are necessarily relevant to a particular analysis. The ability to select a relevant ratio or ratios to answer the research question is an analytical skill. Finally, as with financial analysis in general, ratio analysis does not stop with computation; interpretation of the result is essential. In practice, differences in ratios across time and across companies can be subtle, and interpretation is situation specific.

## The Universe of Ratios

No authoritative bodies specify the exact formulas for computing ratios or provide a standard, comprehensive list of ratios. Formulas and even names of ratios often differ from analyst to analyst or from database to database. The number of different ratios that can be created is practically limitless. Several widely accepted ratios, however, have been found to be useful, which are the focus of this module. The analyst should be aware that different ratios may be used in practice and that certain industries have unique ratios tailored to the characteristics of that industry. When faced with an unfamiliar ratio, the analyst can examine the underlying formula to gain insight into what the ratio is measuring. For example, consider the following ratio formula:

[^0]Never having seen this ratio, an analyst might question whether a result of 12 percent is better than 8 percent. The answer can be found in the ratio itself. The numerator is operating income and the denominator is average total assets, so the ratio can be interpreted as the amount of operating income generated per unit of assets. For every EUR100 of average total assets, generating EUR12 of operating income is better than generating EUR8 of operating income. Furthermore, it is apparent that this particular ratio is an indicator of profitability (as well as efficiency in use of assets in generating operating profits). When encountering a ratio for the first time, the analyst should evaluate the numerator and denominator to assess what the ratio is attempting to measure and how it should be interpreted. This is demonstrated in Example 3.

## EXAMPLE 3

## Interpreting a Financial Ratio

A US insurance company reports that its "combined ratio" is determined by dividing losses and expenses incurred by net premiums earned. It reports the following combined ratios:

## Exhibit 5: Combined Ratio

| Fiscal Year | $\mathbf{5}$ | $\mathbf{4}$ | $\mathbf{3}$ | $\mathbf{2}$ | $\mathbf{1}$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Combined <br> ratio | $90.1 \%$ | $104.0 \%$ | $98.5 \%$ | $104.1 \%$ | $101.1 \%$ |

1. Explain what this ratio is measuring and compare the results reported for each of the years shown in the chart. What other information might an analyst want to review before making any conclusions on this information?

## Solution:

The combined ratio is a profitability measure. The ratio is explaining how much costs (losses and expenses) were incurred for every dollar of revenue (net premiums earned). The underlying formula indicates that a lower value for this ratio is better. The year 5 ratio of 90.1 percent means that for every dollar of net premiums earned, the costs were USD0.901, yielding a gross profit of $\$ 0.099$. Ratios greater than 100 percent indicate an overall loss. A review of the data indicates that there does not seem to be a consistent trend in this ratio. Profits were achieved in years 5 and 3 . The results for years 4 and 2 show the most significant costs at approximately 104 percent.
The analyst would want to discuss this data further with management and understand the characteristics of the underlying business. He or she would want to understand why the results are so volatile. The analyst would also want to determine what should be used as a benchmark for this ratio.

The Operating income/Average total assets ratio is one of many versions of the return on assets (ROA) ratio. Note that there are other ways of specifying this formula based on how assets are defined. Some financial ratio databases compute ROA using the ending value of assets rather than average assets. In limited cases, one may also see beginning assets in the denominator. Which one is right? It depends on what you are trying to measure and the underlying company trends. If the company has a stable level of assets, the answer will not differ greatly under the three measures of assets (beginning, average, and ending). However, if the assets are growing (or shrinking), the results will differ among the three measures. When assets are growing, operating
income divided by ending assets may not make sense because some of the income would have been generated before some assets were purchased, and this would understate the company's performance. Similarly, if beginning assets are used, some of the operating income later in the year may have been generated only because of the addition of assets; therefore, the ratio would overstate the company's performance. Because operating income occurs throughout the period, it generally makes sense to use some average measure of assets. A good general rule is that when an income statement or cash flow statement number is in the numerator of a ratio and a balance sheet number is in the denominator, then an average should be used for the denominator. It is generally not necessary to use averages when only balance sheet numbers are used in both the numerator and denominator because both are determined as of the same date. However, in some instances, even ratios that only use balance sheet data may use averages. For example, return on equity (ROE), which is defined as net income divided by average shareholders' equity, can be decomposed into other ratios, some of which only use balance sheet data. In decomposing ROE into component ratios, if an average is used in one of the component ratios, then it should be used in the other component ratios. The decomposition of ROE is discussed further in a later lesson.

If an average is used, judgment is also required about what average should be used. For simplicity, most ratio databases use a simple average of the beginning and end-of-year balance sheet amounts. If the company's business is seasonal so that levels of assets vary by interim period (semiannual or quarterly), then it may be beneficial to take an average over all interim periods, if available. (If the analyst is working within a company and has access to monthly data, this can also be used.)

## Value, Purposes, and Limitations of Ratio Analysis

The value of ratio analysis is that it enables a financial analyst to evaluate past performance, assess the current financial position of the company, and gain insights useful for projecting future results. As noted previously, the ratio itself is not "the answer" but is an indicator of some aspect of a company's performance. Financial ratios provide insights into the following:

- economic relationships within a company that help analysts project earnings and free cash flow;
- a company's financial flexibility, or ability to obtain the cash required to grow and meet its obligations, even if unexpected circumstances develop;
- management's ability;
- changes in the company or industry over time; and
- comparability with peer companies or the relevant industry(ies).

Ratio analysis also has limitations. Factors to consider include the following:

- The heterogeneity or homogeneity of a company's operating activities. Companies may have divisions operating in many different industries. This can make it difficult to find comparable industry ratios to use for comparison purposes.
- The need to determine whether the results of the ratio analysis are consistent. One set of ratios may indicate a problem, whereas another set may indicate that the potential problem is only short term in nature.
- The need to use judgment. A key issue is whether a ratio for a company is within a reasonable range. Although financial ratios are used to help assess the growth potential and risk of a company, they cannot be used alone to directly value a company or its securities, or to determine its
creditworthiness. The entire operation of the company must be examined, and the external economic and industry setting in which it is operating must be considered when interpreting financial ratios.
- The use of alternative accounting methods. Companies frequently have latitude when choosing certain accounting methods. Ratios taken from financial statements that employ different accounting choices may not be comparable unless adjustments are made. Some important accounting considerations include the following:
- FIFO (first in, first out), LIFO (last in, first out), or average cost inventory valuation methods (International Financial Reporting Standards [IFRS] does not allow LIFO);
- Cost or equity methods of accounting for unconsolidated affiliates;
- Straight-line or accelerated methods of depreciation; and
- Operating or finance lease treatment for lessors (under US GAAP, the type of lease affects classifications of expenses; under IFRS, operating lease treatment for lessors is not applicable).

Convergence efforts between IFRS and US GAAP make the financial statements of different companies more comparable and may overcome some of these difficulties. Nonetheless, there will remain accounting choices that the analyst must consider.

## Sources of Ratios

Ratios may be computed using data obtained directly from companies' financial statements or from a database such as Bloomberg, Compustat, FactSet, or Thomson Reuters. The information provided by the database may include information as reported in companies' financial statements and ratios calculated based on the information. These databases are popular because they provide easy access to many years of historical data so that trends over time can be examined. They also allow for ratio calculations based on periods other than the company's fiscal year, such as for the trailing 12 months (TTM) or most recent quarter (MRQ).

## EXAMPLE 4

## Trailing 12 Months

1. On 15 July, an analyst is examining a company with a fiscal year ending on 31 December. Use the following data to calculate the company's TTM earnings (for the period ended 30 June 2018):

- Earnings for the year ended 31 December 2017: USD1,200;
- Earnings for the six months ended 30 June 2017: USD550; and
- Earnings for the six months ended 30 June 2018: USD750.


## Solution:

The company's TTM earnings is USD1,400, calculated as USD1,200 USD550 + USD750.

Analysts should be aware that the underlying formulas for ratios may differ by vendor. The formula used should be obtained from the vendor, and the analyst should determine whether any adjustments are necessary. Furthermore, database providers often exercise judgment when classifying items. For example, operating income may
not appear directly on a company's income statement, and the vendor may use judgment to classify income statement items as "operating" or "non-operating." Variation in such judgments would affect any computation involving operating income. It is therefore a good practice to use the same source for data when comparing different companies or when evaluating the historical record of a single company. Analysts should verify the consistency of formulas and data classifications by the data source. Analysts should also be mindful of the judgments made by a vendor in data classifications and refer to the source financial statements until they are comfortable that the classifications are appropriate.

Collection of financial data from regulatory filings and calculation of ratios can be automated. The eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is a mechanism that attaches "smart tags" to financial information (e.g., total assets), so that software can automatically collect the data and perform desired computations. The organization developing XBRL (www.xbrl.org) is an international nonprofit consortium of more than 600 members from companies, associations, and agencies, including the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Many stock exchanges and regulatory agencies around the world now use XBRL for receiving and distributing public financial reports from listed companies.

Analysts can compare a subject company to similar (peer) companies in vendor databases or use aggregate industry data. For non-public companies, aggregate industry data can be obtained from such sources as Annual Statement Studies by the Risk Management Association or Dun \& Bradstreet. These publications typically provide industry data with companies sorted into quartiles. By definition, 25 percent of companies' ratios fall within the lowest quartile, 25 percent have ratios between the lower quartile and median value, and so on. Analysts can then determine a company's relative standing in the industry.

## COMMON SIZE BALANCE SHEETS AND INCOME STATEMENTS

describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis, including their uses and limitations

Common-size analysis involves expressing financial data, including entire financial statements, in relation to a single financial statement item, or base. Items used most frequently as the bases are total assets or revenue. In essence, common-size analysis creates a ratio between every financial statement item and the base item. Common-size analysis was demonstrated in earlier modules for the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. In this lesson, we present common-size analysis of financial statements in greater detail and include further discussion of their interpretation.

Common-Size Analysis of the Balance Sheet A vertical common-size balance sheet, prepared by dividing each item on the balance sheet by the same period's total assets and expressing the results as percentages, highlights the composition of the balance sheet. What is the mix of assets being used? How is the company financing itself? How does one company's balance sheet composition compare with that of peer companies, and what are the reasons for any differences? A horizontal common-size balance sheet, prepared by computing the increase or decrease in percentage terms of each balance sheet item from the prior year or prepared by dividing the quantity of each item by a base year quantity of the item, highlights changes in items. These changes can be compared to expectations.

Exhibit 6 presents a vertical common-size (partial) balance sheet for a hypothetical company in two time periods. In this example, receivables have increased from 35 percent to 57 percent of total assets and the ratio has increased by 63 percent from Period 1 to Period 2. What are possible reasons for such an increase? The increase might indicate that the company is making more of its sales on a credit basis rather than a cash basis, perhaps in response to some action taken by a competitor. Alternatively, the increase in receivables as a percentage of assets may have occurred because of a change in another current asset category, for example, a decrease in the level of inventory; the analyst would then need to investigate why that asset category has changed. Another possible reason for the increase in receivables as a percentage of assets is that the company has lowered its credit standards, relaxed its collection procedures, or adopted more aggressive revenue recognition policies. The analyst can turn to other comparisons and ratios (e.g., comparing the rate of growth in accounts receivable with the rate of growth in sales) to help determine which explanation is most likely.

Exhibit 6: Vertical Common-Size (Partial) Balance Sheet for a Hypothetical Company

|  | Period 1 Percent of Total Assets | Period 2 Percent of Total Assets |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cash | 25 | 15 |
| Receivables | 35 | 57 |
| Inventory | 35 | 20 |
| Fixed assets, net of depreciation | 5 | 8 |
| Total assets | 100 | 100 |

## Common-Size Analysis of the Income Statement

A vertical common-size income statement divides each income statement item by revenue, or sometimes by total assets (especially in the case of financial institutions). If there are multiple revenue sources, a decomposition of revenue in percentage terms is useful. Exhibit 7 presents a hypothetical company's vertical common-size income statement in two time periods. Revenue is separated into the company's four services, each shown as a percentage of total revenue.

In this example, revenues from Service A have become a far greater percentage of the company's total revenue ( 30 percent in Period 1 and 45 percent in Period 2). What are possible reasons for and implications of this change in business mix? Did the company make a strategic decision to sell more of Service A, perhaps because it is more profitable? Apparently not, because the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) declined from 53 percent of sales to 45 percent, so other possible explanations should be examined. In addition, we note from the composition of operating expenses that the main reason for this decline in profitability is that salaries and employee benefits have increased from 15 percent to 25 percent of total revenue. Are more highly compensated employees required for Service A? Were higher training costs incurred to increase revenues from Service A? If the analyst wants to predict future performance, the causes of these changes must be understood.

In addition, Exhibit 7 shows that the company's income tax as a percentage of sales has declined dramatically (from 15 percent to 8 percent). Furthermore, taxes as a percentage of earnings before tax (EBT) (the effective tax rate, which is usually the
more relevant comparison), have decreased from 36 percent ( $=15 / 42$ ) to 24 percent (= 8/34). Is Service A, which in Period 2 is a greater percentage of total revenue, provided in a jurisdiction with lower tax rates? If not, what is the explanation for the change in effective tax rate?

The observations based on Exhibit 7 summarize the issues that can be raised through analysis of the vertical common-size income statement.

Exhibit 7: Vertical Common-Size Income Statement for Hypothetical Company

|  | Period 1Percent of Total Revenue | Period 2Percent of Total Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue source: Service A | 30 | 45 |
| Revenue source: Service B | 23 | 20 |
| Revenue source: Service C | 30 | 30 |
| Revenue source: Service D | 17 | 5 |
| Total revenue | 100 | 100 |
| Operating expenses (excluding depreciation) |  |  |
| Salaries and employee benefits | 15 | 25 |
| Administrative expenses | 22 | 20 |
| Rent expense | 10 | 10 |
| EBITDA | 53 | 45 |
| Depreciation and amortization | 4 | 4 |
| EBIT | 49 | 41 |
| Interest paid | 7 | 7 |
| EBT | 42 | 34 |
| Income tax provision | 15 | 8 |
| Net income | 27 | 26 |

EBIT $=$ earnings before interest and tax.

## CROSS-SECTIONAL, TREND ANALYSIS, AND RELATIONSHIPS IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis, including their uses and limitations

As noted previously, ratios and common-size statements derive their utility through comparison. Cross-sectional analysis (sometimes called "relative analysis") compares a specific metric for one company with the same metric for another company or group of companies measured at the same point in time or over the same range of time, allowing comparisons even though the companies might be of significantly different sizes or operate in different currencies. This is illustrated in Exhibit 8.

Exhibit 8: Vertical Common-Size (Partial) Balance Sheet for Two Hypothetical Companies

| Assets | Company 1 Percent of Total Assets | Company 2 Percent of Total Assets |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cash | 38 | 12 |
| Receivables | 33 | 55 |
| Inventory | 27 | 24 |
| Fixed assets net of depreciation | 1 | 2 |
| Investments | 1 | 7 |
| Total Assets | 100 | 100 |

Exhibit 8 presents a vertical common-size (partial) balance sheet for two hypothetical companies at the same point in time. Company 1 is clearly more liquid (liquidity is a function of how quickly assets can be converted into cash) than Company 2, which has only 12 percent of assets available as cash, compared with the highly liquid Company 1, which has 38 percent of assets available as cash. Given that cash is generally a relatively low-yielding asset and thus not a particularly efficient use of excess funds, why does Company 1 hold such a large percentage of total assets in cash? Perhaps the company is preparing for an acquisition, or maintains a large cash position as insulation from a particularly volatile operating environment. Another issue highlighted by the comparison in this example is the relatively high percentage of receivables in Company 2's assets, which may indicate a greater proportion of credit sales, overall changes in asset composition, lower credit or collection standards, or aggressive accounting policies.

## Trend Analysis

When looking at financial statements and ratios, trends in the data, whether they are improving or deteriorating, are as important as the current absolute or relative levels. Trend analysis provides important information regarding historical performance and growth and, given a sufficiently long history of accurate seasonal information, can be of great assistance as a planning and forecasting tool for management and analysts.

Exhibit 9 presents a partial balance sheet for a hypothetical company over five periods. The last two columns of the table show the changes for Period 5 compared with Period 4, expressed both in absolute currency (in this case, dollars) and in percentages. A small percentage change could hide a significant currency change and vice versa, prompting the analyst to investigate the reasons despite one of the changes being relatively small. In this example, the largest percentage change was in investments, which decreased by 33.3 percent. However, an examination of the absolute currency amount of changes shows that investments changed by only USD2 million, and the more significant change was the USD12 million increase in receivables.

Another way to present data covering a period of time is to show each item in relation to the same item in a base year (i.e., a horizontal common-size balance sheet). Exhibit 10 and Exhibit 11 illustrate alternative presentations of horizontal common-size balance sheets. Exhibit 10 presents the information from the same partial balance sheet as in Exhibit 9, but indexes each item relative to the same item in Period 1. For example, in Period 2, the company had USD29 million cash, which is 74 percent or 0.74 of the amount of cash it had in Period 1. Expressed as an index relative to Period 1, where each item in Period 1 is given a value of 1.00 , the value in Period 2 would be 0.74 (USD29/USD39 = 0.74). In Period 3, the company had USD27 million cash, which is 69 percent of the amount of cash it had in Period 1 (USD27/USD39 $=0.69$ ).

Exhibit 11 presents the percentage change in each item, relative to the previous year. For example, the change in cash from Period 1 to Period 2 was -25.6 percent (USD29/ USD39-1 $=-0.256$ ), and the change in cash from Period 2 to Period 3 was -6.9 percent (USD27/USD29-1 = -0.069). An analyst will select the horizontal common-size balance that addresses the particular period of interest. Exhibit 10 clearly highlights that in Period 5 compared to Period 1, the company has less than half the amount of cash, four times the amount of investments, and eight times the amount of property, plant, and equipment. Exhibit 11 highlights year-to-year changes: For example, cash has declined in each period. Presenting data this way highlights significant changes. Again, note that a mathematically big change is not necessarily an important change. For example, fixed assets increased 100 percent (i.e., doubled between Period 1 and 2); however, as a proportion of total assets, fixed assets increased from 1 percent of total assets to 2 percent of total assets. The company's working capital assets (receivables and inventory) are a far higher proportion of total assets and would likely warrant more attention from an analyst.

An analysis of horizontal common-size balance sheets highlights structural changes that have occurred in a business. Past trends are obviously not necessarily an accurate predictor of the future, especially when the economic or competitive environment changes. An examination of past trends is more valuable when the macroeconomic and competitive environments are relatively stable and when the analyst is reviewing a stable or mature business. However, even in less stable contexts, historical analysis can serve as a basis for developing expectations. Understanding of past trends is helpful in assessing whether these trends are likely to continue or if the trend is likely to change direction.

| Fixed assets net of depreciation | 1.00 | 2.00 | 6.00 | 9.00 | 8.00 |
| Total assets | 1.00 | 1.04 | 1.13 | 1.26 | 1.34 |

Exhibit 11: Horizontal Common-Size (Partial) Balance Sheet for a Hypothetical Company over Five Periods, with Percent Change in Each Item Relative to the Prior Period

| Assets | Period |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | 2 (\%) | 3 (\%) | 4 (\%) | 5 (\%) |
| Cash | -25.6 | -6.9 | -29.6 | -15.8 |
| Investments | 600.0 | 0.0 | -14.3 | -33.3 |
| Receivables | -6.8 | -9.8 | 81.1 | 17.9 |
| Inventory | 66.7 | 44.0 | -30.6 | 8.0 |
| Fixed assets net of depreciation | 100.0 | 200.0 | 50.0 | -11.1 |
| Total assets | 4.0 | 8.7 | 11.5 | 6.3 |

One measure of success is for a company to grow at a rate greater than the rate of the overall market in which it operates. Companies that grow slowly may find themselves unable to attract equity capital. Conversely, companies that grow too quickly may find that their administrative and management information systems cannot keep up with the rate of expansion.

## Relationships Among Financial Statements

Trend data generated by a horizontal common-size analysis can be compared across financial statements. For example, the growth rate of assets for the hypothetical company in Exhibit 12 can be compared with the company's growth in revenue over the same period of time. If revenue is growing more quickly than assets, the company may be increasing its efficiency (i.e., generating more revenue for every dollar invested in assets).

As another example, consider the following year-over-year percentage changes for a hypothetical company:

Exhibit 12: Year-over-Year Percentage Changes

| Revenue | +20\% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Net income | +25\% |
| Operating cash flow | -10\% |
| Total assets | +30\% |

Net income is growing faster than revenue, which indicates increasing profitability. However, the analyst would need to determine whether the faster growth in net income resulted from continuing operations or from non-operating, non-recurring items. In addition, the 10 percent decline in operating cash flow despite increasing revenue and net income clearly warrants further investigation because it could indicate a problem with earnings quality (perhaps aggressive reporting of revenue). Lastly, the fact that assets have grown faster than revenue indicates the company's efficiency may be declining. The analyst should examine the composition of the increase in assets and the reasons for the changes. Example 5 illustrates a historical example of a company for which comparisons of trend data from different financial statements were actually indicative of aggressive accounting policies.

## EXAMPLE 5

## Use of Comparative Growth Information ${ }^{1}$

In July 1996, Sunbeam, a US company, brought in new management to turn the company around. In the following year, 1997, using 1996 as the base, the following was observed based on reported numbers:

Exhibit 13: Sunbeam Revenue

| Revenue | $\mathbf{+ 1 9}$ percent |
| :--- | :---: |
| Inventory | +58 percent |
| Receivables | +38 percent |

It is generally more desirable to observe inventory and receivables growing at a slower (or similar) rate than revenue growth. Receivables growing faster than revenue can indicate operational issues, such as lower credit standards or aggressive accounting policies for revenue recognition. Similarly, inventory growing faster than revenue can indicate an operational problem with obsolescence or aggressive accounting policies, such as an improper overstatement of inventory to increase profits.

In this case, the explanation lay in aggressive accounting policies. Sunbeam was later charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission with improperly accelerating the recognition of revenue and engaging in other practices, such as billing customers for inventory prior to shipment.

## THE USE OF GRAPHS AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS

describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis, including their uses and limitations

[^1]Graphs facilitate comparison of performance and financial structure over time, highlighting changes in significant aspects of business operations. In addition, graphs provide the analyst (and management) with a visual overview of risk trends in a business. Graphs may also be used effectively to communicate the analyst's conclusions regarding financial condition and risk management aspects.

Exhibit 14 presents the information from Exhibit 9 in a stacked column format. The graph makes the significant decline in cash and growth in receivables (both in absolute terms and as a percentage of assets) readily apparent. In Exhibit 14, the vertical axis shows US dollar millions and the horizontal axis denotes the period.

Choosing the appropriate graph to communicate the most significant conclusions of a financial analysis is a skill. In general, pie graphs are most useful to communicate the composition of a total value (e.g., assets over a limited amount of time, say one or two periods). Line graphs are useful when the focus is on the change in amount for a limited number of items over a relatively longer time period. When the composition and amounts, as well as their change over time, are all important, a stacked column graph can be useful.

## Exhibit 14: Stacked Column Graph of Asset Composition of Hypothetical Company over Five Periods

When comparing Period 5 with Period 4, the growth in receivables appears to be within normal bounds; but when comparing Period 5 with earlier periods, the dramatic growth becomes apparent. In the same manner, a simple line graph will also illustrate the growth trends in key financial variables. Exhibit 15 presents the information from Exhibit 9A as a line graph, illustrating the growth of assets of a hypothetical company over five periods. The steady decline in cash, volatile movements of inventory, and dramatic growth of receivables is clearly illustrated. Again, the vertical axis is shown in US dollar millions and the horizontal axis denotes periods.

## Regression Analysis

When analyzing the trend in a specific line item or ratio, frequently it is possible simply to visually evaluate the changes. For more complex situations, regression analysis can help identify relationships (or correlation) between variables. For example, a regression analysis could relate a company's sales to GDP over time, providing insight into whether the company is cyclical. In addition, the statistical relationship between sales and GDP could be used as a basis for forecasting sales.

Other examples in which regression analysis may be useful include the relationship between a company's sales and inventory over time, or the relationship between hotel occupancy and a company's hotel revenues. In addition to providing a basis for forecasting, regression analysis facilitates identification of items or ratios that are not behaving as expected, given historical statistical relationships.

## COMMON RATIO CATEGORIES, INTERPRETATION, AND CONTEXT

calculate and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, and profitability ratios

In the previous lesson, we focused on ratios resulting from common-size analysis. In this lesson, we expand the discussion to include other commonly used financial ratios and the broad classes into which they are categorized. There is some overlap
with common-size financial statement ratios. For example, a common indicator of profitability is the net profit margin, which is calculated as net income divided by sales. This ratio appears on a vertical common-size income statement. Other ratios involve information from multiple financial statements or even data from outside the financial statements.

Because of the large number of ratios, it is helpful to think about ratios in terms of broad categories based on what aspects of performance a ratio is intended to detect. Financial analysts and data vendors use a variety of categories to classify ratios. The category names and the ratios included in each category can differ. Common ratio categories include activity, liquidity, solvency, and profitability, which were introduced in earlier modules in Corporate Issuers. These categories are summarized in Exhibit 16. Each category measures a different aspect of the company's business, but all are useful in evaluating a company's overall ability to generate cash flows from operating its business and the associated risks.

Exhibit 16: Categories of Financial Ratios

| Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Activity | Activity ratios measure the efficiency of a company's operations, such as the collection of receivables and management of inventory. |
| Liquidity | Liquidity ratios measure the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. |
| Solvency | Solvency ratios measure a company's ability to meet long-term obligations. Subsets of these ratios are also known as "leverage" and "long-term debt" ratios. |
| Profitability | Profitability ratios measure the company's ability to generate profits from its resources (assets) or sales. |

## Interpretation and Context

Financial ratios can be interpreted only in the context of other information. In general, the financial ratios of a company are compared with those of its major competitors (cross-sectional and trend analysis) and to the company's prior periods (trend analysis). The goal is to understand the underlying causes of divergence between a company's ratios and those of the industry. Even ratios that remain consistent require understanding because consistency can sometimes indicate accounting policies selected to smooth earnings. An analyst should evaluate financial ratios in the context of the following:

1. Prior period results. Trend analysis can reveal whether a company's performance and position are weakening or strengthening.
2. Expectations. These are point or range estimates for key values, such as sales growth, profit margins, and leverage ratios, that are specified by the analyst or external analysts before results are published. Differences from expectations should be scrutinized for setting expectations in subsequent periods.
3. Industry peers and competitors (cross-sectional analysis). A company can be compared with others in its industry by relating its financial ratios to industry norms or to a subset of the companies in an industry. When industry norms are used to make judgments, care must be taken for the following reasons:

- Companies may have several different lines of business. This will cause aggregate financial ratios to be distorted. It is better to examine indus-try-specific ratios by lines of business.
- Differences in business model and corporate strategies can affect certain financial ratios.
- Some ratios are industry specific, and not all ratios are important to all industries.
- Differences in accounting methods used by companies can distort financial ratios.

4. Company goals and strategy. Actual ratios can be compared with company objectives to determine whether objectives are being attained and whether the results are consistent with the company's strategy.
5. Economic conditions. For cyclical companies, financial ratios tend to improve when the economy is strong and weaken during recessions. Therefore, financial ratios should be examined in light of the current phase of the business cycle.

The following lessons discuss the calculation and interpretation of activity, liquidity, solvency, and profitability ratios using a company's financial statements.

## ACTIVITY RATIOS

calculate and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, and profitability ratios

Activity ratios, also known as asset utilization ratios or operating efficiency ratios, are measures of operational performance-how effectively the company is using working capital and longer term assets. Since working capital efficiency has a direct impact on liquidity, some activity ratios are also useful in assessing liquidity.

## Calculation of Activity Ratios

Exhibit 17 presents commonly used activity ratios.

Exhibit 17: Definitions of Commonly Used Activity Ratios

| Activity Ratios | Numerator | Denominator |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Inventory turnover | Cost of sales or cost of goods sold | Average inventory |
| Days of inventory on hand (DOH) | Number of days in period | Inventory turnover |
| Receivables turnover | Revenue | Average receivables |
| Days of sales outstanding (DSO) | Number of days in period | Receivables turnover |
| Payables turnover | Cost of sales or cost of goods sold | Average trade payables |
| Number of days of payables | Number of days in period | Payables turnover |
