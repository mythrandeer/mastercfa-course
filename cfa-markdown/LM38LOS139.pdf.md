- Forecasting revenue for a company faced with inflation in input costs requires an understanding of the price elasticity of the products, the different rates of cost inflation in the countries where the company is active, and the likely inflation in costs relevant to a company's individual product categories.
- Faced with rising input prices, a company might decide to preserve its margins by passing on the costs to its customers, or it might decide to accept some margin reduction to increase its market share.
- The choice of the forecast time horizon can be influenced by certain factors, including the investment strategy for which the security is being considered, the cyclicality of the industry, company-specific factors, and the analyst's employer's preferences.
- Normalized earnings are the expected level of mid-cycle earnings for a company in the absence of any unusual or temporary factors that affect profitability.
- One of the greatest challenges facing the analyst is anticipating inflection points, such as from economic disruption, regulation, and technology, when the future will look significantly different from the recent past.


## BUILDING A FINANCIAL STATEMENT MODEL

demonstrate the development of a sales-based pro forma company model

In this module, we apply the principles covered in earlier modules in Financial Statement Analysis and Corporate Issuers in a demonstration of building a financial statement model. The subject company is the Rémy Cointreau Group (Rémy), a French company that primarily sells spirits. After providing a brief overview of the company, we will focus primarily on the mechanics of constructing pro forma income statements, statements of cash flows, and balance sheets. Data sources for this example include the company's fiscal year ended 31 March 2021 and 2020 annual reports, the company's interim reports, and corresponding investor presentations for additional information on the underlying results of the respective divisions. While forecasts are described in some detail here, later modules in company analysis in the Equity topic area will discuss forecasting in much greater detail.

## Company Overview

Rémy, whose reporting year ends 31 March, operates and reports three business segments:

1. Cognac. This division, composed primarily of Rémy Martin brand cognac, represented approximately 73 percent of FY2021 (year-end 31 March 2021) revenue and 94 percent of total current operating profit. Current operating profit is a non-IFRS measure reported by Rémy equal to IFRS operating profit excluding items related to discontinued brands or items deemed infrequent or immaterial, such as impairment or litigation provisions.
2. Liqueurs \& Spirits. A diverse portfolio of spirits brands, the main brands in this segment are Cointreau, Metaxa, St-Rémy, Mount Gay, Bruichladdich, and The Botanist. The segment represented approximately 25 percent of FY2021 revenue and 14 percent of current operating profits.
3. Partner Brands. This segment includes other companies' brands that are marketed through Rémy's distribution network. They represented approximately 3 percent of FY2021 revenue and just under 0 percent of current operating profit, earning a slight operating loss in FY2021 of -EUR0.8 million. This division's importance has declined significantly over time as the company discontinued distribution ("partner brand") contracts.

Segment financial information is summarized in Exhibit 1. As shown, the company's largest business segment is also its most profitable: The Cognac segment earned a current operating profit margin of approximately 30 percent (= EUR221 million/ EUR735 million) in fiscal year 2021. Exhibits are in the downloadable Microsoft Excel workbook in a single worksheet titled "Rémy." We strongly recommend following along with the Excel workbook and exploring the model construction in detail.

## Revenue Forecast

For each segment, the change in revenue is driven by volume, price, and foreign currency estimates that are based on historical trends as adjusted for expected deviations from trend. Price changes refer not only to price changes for a single product but also to changes in mix, which are defined as changes resulting from selling varying quantities of higher- and lower-priced products. Changes in revenue attributable to volume or price/mix are organic growth and are shown separately from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures (scope change) and foreign exchange (forex impact in the model).

In the Cognac segment, historical volume growth is usually in the 4 to -6 percent range. For future years, volume growth is expected to remain robust but slower than the 9.1 percent achieved in 2021 as the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated recession fades (volumes were down 10.1 percent in FY2020). The growing number of affluent Asian consumers will likely keep demand high, while developed market consumption is likely to be rather flat. In the model, the assumption is for 7 percent volume growth in 2022, declining to 6 percent in 2023 and 2024.

Price/mix contributed approximately 6.0 percent, 2.6 percent, and -5.4 percent to the Cognac segment revenue growth in FY2019, FY2020, and FY2021, respectively. Although the impact of price/mix on revenue growth has fluctuated in recent years, price/mix will likely remain a relatively significant contributor to revenue growth in the future given the favorable structure of the industry and the company's efforts to increase the share of revenues accounted for by what it calls "exceptional spirits" (those that cost more than USD50 per bottle and are seeing a 10 percent annual demand growth). A 4 percent price/mix contribution to revenue growth is assumed in 2022, with the trend maintained into 2023 and 2024. The combined projections for 2022 of 7 percent volume growth and 4 percent price/mix impact results in overall organic revenue growth of 11.3 percent, calculated as $[(1+0.07) \times(1+0.04)]-1$.

In addition to the impact of volume and price/mix, Rémy's revenues are affected by movements in exchange rates. Company disclosures indicate that more than 70 percent of revenues are realized outside the eurozone, whereas most of Rémy's production occurs within the eurozone. The model forecasts no foreign currency impact on revenue in the 2022-24 forecast period.

Exhibit 3 summarizes historical and projected information for the Cognac segment's revenue.

Exhibit 3: Historical and Projected Information for Cognac Segment Revenue

|  | FY2018 | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 | FY2022E | FY2023E | FY2024E |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cognac Segment Revenues (euro millions) | 760 | 774 | 736 | 735 | 818 | 902 | 994 |
| YoY\% | 7.4\% | 1.9\% | -5.0\% | -0.1\% | 11.3\% | 10.2\% | 10.2\% |
| Volume growth (\%) | 6.0\% | 5.9\% | -10.1\% | 9.1\% | 7.0\% | 6.0\% | 6.0\% |
| Price/mix (\%) | 7.2\% | 6.0\% | 2.6\% | -5.4\% | 4.0\% | 4.0\% | 4.0\% |
| Organic growth (\%) | 13.6\% | 12.3\% | -7.8\% | 3.2\% | 11.3\% | 10.2\% | 10.2\% |
| Forex impact and scope change (\%) | -5.8\% | -4.0\% | 2.5\% | -3.8\% | 0.0\% | 0.0\% | 0.0\% |
| Effect of IFRS 15 adoption | 0.0\% | -6.0\% | 0.0\% | 0.0\% | 0.0\% | 0.0\% | 0.0\% |
| YoY\% | 7.8\% | 2.3\% | -5.3\% | -0.6\% | 11.3\% | 10.2\% | 10.2\% |

A similar analysis can be performed to project revenue for the other segments. Then, the amounts can be summed to derive projected consolidated revenue.

## COGS

Rémy's gross margin has remained roughly flat from FY2018 (67.5 percent) to FY2021 ( 67.3 percent) as total sales have decreased modestly. Going forward, we project gross margin to increase by 100 bps in each of the next three years based on increasing total revenues, particularly from price/mix, which is strongly accretive to gross margin (see the previous section on "Revenue Forecast"). Management has set a FY2030 objective of a 72.0 percent gross margin, largely in line with our forecasts. Should revenue growth prove more (less) robust than our forecast, we expect more (less) gross margin accretion.

## SG\&A Expenses and Other Operating Expenses

Distribution costs increased significantly over time, from 26.1 percent of revenue in FY2009 (not shown in the exhibits) to 38 percent in FY2018, and thereafter decreasing to 33.8 percent in FY2021. In particular, the setup of Rémy's distribution network in Asia increased the cost base. Rémy is very committed to its brand building and is also diversifying geographically. We estimate modest increases in distribution costs as a percentage of revenue, of 20 bps per year. Administrative costs as a percentage of revenue have increased from 8.1 percent to 10.1 percent as revenues have fallen, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the growth in absolute euro amounts has been modest, with costs of approximately EUR100 million in FY2019-FY2021. We expect 1 percent growth in administrative costs per year through FY2024E.

Other operating expenses (income), composed primarily of provisions for impairments of intangible assets, restructurings, and divestiture gains, has fluctuated from -EUR2 million to EUR20 million from FY2018 to FY2021. Because we do not anticipate any transactions that would result in other operating expenses or income, we forecast zero for this line in the model.

Exhibit 4 provides a consolidated income statement for Rémy through the EBIT and EBIT margin line.

| EBIT margin | 19.8\% | 23.6\% | 19.1\% | 23.3\% | 24.8\% | 26.2\% | 27.6\% |

## Operating Profit by Segment

In this section, we alternatively estimate operating profit and margin using a segment approach. Rémy discloses current operating profit for each of its segments as well as an operating cost at the corporate or holding company level. Recall that current operating profit is a non-IFRS measure that excludes certain items. These certain items are disclosed on Rémy's income statement as "Other operating expenses (income)." Therefore, the sum of the segment current operating profit equals consolidated EBIT before other operating expenses (income).

For the Cognac segment, the forecast of higher revenue growth, based partially on strong price/mix growth, assumes an improving product mix that will also result in a higher gross margin. But the benefit to gross margin will be somewhat mitigated by higher distribution costs. Thus, the expectation is that the Cognac segment's operating margin will increase to 33.4 percent by FY2024. As a benchmark, this forecast can be compared with the financial results reported by Hennessy (part of LVMH), another cognac brand. That company's operating margin in its Wine \& Spirits segment in FY2017-2019 was 30-32 percent, though that business has a significantly higher mix of lower-priced products with lower gross margins.

For the other segments, there is not much upside. In the Liqueurs \& Spirits division, we assume operating margin to increase modestly to 13.6 percent. In total, Rémy Cointreau Group's consolidated operating margin is forecast to improve from 23.4 percent in FY2021 to 27.6 percent in FY2024, largely because of growth and margin improvement in the Cognac segment, the most profitable division, and leverage from that sales growth on corporate-level costs.

While a segment approach like Exhibit 5 can be used instead of a consolidated approach to forecasting revenue and operating profit, it is also commonly used as a "check" on the consolidated forecasts. This analysis revealed, for example, that the model relies significantly on margin improvement in the Cognac segment.

| Total current operating profit | 21.0\% | 23.5\% | 21.0\% | 23.4\% | 24.8\% | 26.2\% | 27.6\% |

## Non-Operating Items

Three types of non-operating line items are included in the model: finance expenses (i.e., interest expenses), income taxes, and shares outstanding.

Net finance cost on Rémy's income statement is interest expense on debt less interest income earned on cash and investments. Forecasting net finance cost, therefore, requires estimating the debt and cash positions and interest rates paid and earned.

Companies pay a fixed or variable interest rate on debt. If the interest rate is variable, the rate is typically determined by a market reference rate plus a credit spread. As shown in Exhibit 6, Rémy's interest expenses are fixed and calculated as 1.7 percent incurred on gross debt at the beginning of the period (EUR720 million at end of FY2020). Other financial expenses are assumed to be zero. Gross debt and the interest rate paid on it are estimated to remain flat from the year ended FY2021 level

Although interest income is typically forecasted after forecasting the cash position from the forecasted statement of cash flows, in this case we have simply estimated EUR0 in interest income through the model period; in each of FY2018-FY2021, annual interest income was EUR0, EUR0, EUR0.1, and EUR0.2 million, respectively, because Rémy maintains its liquidity in assets with zero or very low yields. For companies that
own liquid assets with higher interest rates, or in higher interest rate environments, interest income should be forecast in the same manner as interest expense: forecasted cash and investments multiplied by a forecasted interest rate.

Exhibit 6: Debt Position and Financial Costs and Income for Rémy (EUR millions, unless noted)

|  | FY2018 | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 | FY2022E | FY2023E | FY2024E |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Long-term financial debt | 397 | 424 | 452 | 424 | 424 | 424 | 424 |
| Short-term financial debt and accrued interest | 73 | 98 | 268 | 92 | 92 | 92 | 92 |
| Gross debt | 470 | 522 | 720 | 515 | 515 | 515 | 515 |
| Interest expense | 14.5 | 13.7 | 12.9 | 12.1 | 8.7 | 8.7 | 8.7 |
| Interest rate (on beginning balance) |  | 2.9\% | 2.5\% | 1.7\% | 1.7\% | 1.7\% | 1.7\% |
| Interest income | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Net finance cost | 14.5 | 13.7 | 12.8 | 11.9 | 8.7 | 8.7 | 8.7 |

## Corporate Income Tax Forecast

The French statutory corporate income tax rate at the time of analysis is 32 percent. Rémy Cointreau Group's effective tax rate has, over the longer run, been close to the statutory rate. Therefore, an estimated 32 percent effective tax rate is used in the forecast period. Rémy has no material minority interests in any of its subsidiaries.

## Shares Outstanding

Shares outstanding to compute earnings per share (EPS) on the income statement are disclosed in two ways, both weighted averages throughout the fiscal year: basic and diluted. Basic shares outstanding includes common equity securities outstanding, while diluted shares outstanding is a type of what-if analysis; it is basic shares outstanding plus the number of shares from the exercise or conversion of in-the-money instruments, less an assumed repurchase of those if-issued shares.

Typically, the two major factors that affect shares outstanding over time are share issuance related to equity-based compensation of employees (increases shares outstanding) and share repurchases (decreases shares outstanding). Less common but sometimes significant transactions that also affect shares outstanding include acquisitions financed with stock, secondary issuance, and conversions of preferred stock or other instruments to common stock.

Exhibit 7 shows beginning and ending basic shares outstanding for the past six fiscal years as well as the annual net amount of share repurchases and issuance, which were gathered from the statements of stockholders' equity and notes to financial statements. Additionally, the basic and diluted shares outstanding on the income statement used to calculate basic and diluted EPS (weighted averages) are shown and differed by approximately 2.6 million shares in each of the past five years.

Exhibit 7: Shares Outstanding for Rémy (euro millions, unless noted)

|  | FY2016 | FY2017 | FY2018 | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Beginning basic shares outstanding | 48.6 | 48.6 | 49.6 | 50.0 | 49.8 | 49.8 |
| Share repurchases | -0.0 | 0.0 | -0.3 | -1.0 | -0.0 | 0.0 |
| Share issuance | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 0.1 | 0.4 |
| Ending basic shares outstanding | 48.6 | 49.6 | 50.0 | 49.8 | 49.8 | 50.3 |
| Weighted average basic shares | 48.6 | 49.1 | 49.8 | 50.1 | 49.8 | 50.1 |
| Dilutive securities | 0.1 | 2.7 | 2.6 | 2.6 | 2.6 | 2.6 |
| Weighted average diluted shares | 48.7 | 51.8 | 52.4 | 52.7 | 52.4 | 53.1 |

As evident in Exhibit 7, shares outstanding for Rémy have not changed materially in six years because the company does not pay significant share-based compensation nor has it repurchased shares. Additionally, management has not disclosed an intention to repurchase shares in the near term. Therefore, the model assumes that weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding on the income statement remain flat at the FY2021 level.

## Pro Forma Income Statement

Now with the forecast components in place, a consolidated pro forma income statement can be constructed, as shown in Exhibit 8. Although not presented on the face of the income statement as disclosed by the company, the calculation of EBITDA is shown after EBIT by adding depreciation and amortization expense from the statement of cash flows. It is not linked to other quantities on the income statement but merely shown as a useful profitability measure.

## Pro Forma Statement of Cash Flows

The forecast statements of cash flows begin with forecasted net income and other amounts from the forecast income statement, and then typically require estimates for capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization, working capital, share-based compensation, dividends, and share repurchases. Once the forecasted income statements and statements of cash flows are completed, forecasting the balance sheet is largely a matter of properly linking the spreadsheet, as illustrated in Exhibit 9.

## Capital Investments and Depreciation Forecasts

Capital investment, or capex, as a percentage of revenue was 5.3 percent in FY2021. Given the healthy volume growth prospects, we expect capex to remain at a modestly above historical average level of 5.0 percent of sales through FY2024. With Rémy's growing fixed asset base, it is logical that depreciation will increase. The model assumes that depreciation and amortization (D\&A) is equal to 4.2 percent of prior year fixed assets, the average of the past three years. The breakdowns of capex and D\&A are shown in Exhibit 10.

## Working Capital Forecasts

We have assumed that working capital ratios will remain similar to what the company experienced in the FY2018-21 period. In Exhibit 11, we include only the relevant balance sheet items related to revenues and costs (i.e., inventories, accounts receivable, and accounts payable) and keep the other items constant. Rémy Cointreau Group had positive net working capital of 105 percent of its sales in fiscal year 2021. The largest working capital component is inventory because much of Rémy's cognac requires years of aging. Inventory days on hand in FY2021 was 1,493, which reflects an approximate 300-day increase owing to the volume slowdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inventory days are partially mitigated by extended payment terms to suppliers; days payable outstanding has averaged around 500 days since FY2018.

We model the working capital accounts by projecting working capital ratios (days of inventory, days sales outstanding, days payable outstanding) which are combined with the sales and cost of sales forecast to produce projected working capital accounts on the balance sheet. We expect inventory days to decline through FY2024 as the inventory increase that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic is worked through, days sales outstanding to remain at FY2021 levels, and for model days payable outstanding to decline back to an average level, again reflecting a normalization after the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the decrease in inventory days, the model projects a net positive contribution from working capital to the reconciliation of net income to cash flows from operations on the statement of cash flows, which is in stark contrast to prior years' negative contribution.

## Forecasted Cash Flow Statement

With net income, D\&A, change in working capital, capex, and debt estimates already in place, the cash flow statement shown in Exhibit 12 is almost automatically generated by linking the relevant lines on a spreadsheet. The three significant items left to forecast are share-based compensation, share repurchases or issuance, and dividends. Going forward, the model assumes flat share-based compensation, no share repurchases or issuance, and dividends paid equal to the FY2021 level through FY2024. Lines labeled "other" are aggregated and zeroed out going forward because they are immaterial, difficult to forecast, or both.

## Forecasted Balance Sheet

The forecasted balance sheet is given in Exhibit 13 and is based on the combination of the projected income statement (Exhibit 8), the projected statement of cash flows (Exhibit 12), and the historical starting balance sheet. The balance sheet items that were not specifically discussed are held constant, which preserves the accounting identity. For ease of presentation, the stockholders' equity lines (e.g., common stock, additional paid in capital, retained earnings, treasury shares, accumulated other comprehensive income) are aggregated. For each forecast period, common stockholders' equity is the prior year value plus net income and share-based compensation less dividends.

If each of the discussed lines is linked properly-and other lines are held constant from FY2021-the forecasted balance sheet should balance each year. Consult the Rémy worksheet in the downloadable Microsoft Excel workbook for greater detail.

## Valuation Model Inputs

A financial statement model is the starting point for most valuation models. Valuation estimates can be made based on a variety of metrics, including free cash flow, EPS, EBITDA, and EBIT. The company-specific inputs needed to build a discounted cash
flow (DCF) to the firm model (to estimate enterprise value) are shown in Exhibit 14. All the variables are sourced from the forecasted income statements and statements of cash flows.

## BEHAVIORAL FINANCE AND ANALYST FORECASTS

explain how behavioral factors affect analyst forecasts and recommend remedial actions for analyst biases

Studies have shown that experts in many fields persistently make forecasting errors arising from behavioral biases, and investment analysts' models of financial statements are in no way immune. To improve forecasts and the investment decisions based on them, analysts must be aware of the impact of biases and potential remedies for them. Five key behavioral biases that influence analyst forecasts are overconfidence, illusion of control, conservatism, representativeness, and confirmation bias.

## Overconfidence in Forecasting

Overconfidence bias occurs when people demonstrate unwarranted faith in their own abilities. Studies have identified that 90 percent confidence intervals for forecasts, which should leave only 10 percent error rates, turn out to be wrong as much as 40 percent of the time (Russo and Schoemaker 1992). Studies have also suggested that individuals are more confident when making contrarian predictions that counter the consensus. That is, overconfidence arises more frequently when forecasting what others do not expect (Dunning, Griffin, Milojkovic, and Ross 1990).

To mitigate overconfidence bias, analysts should record and share their forecasts and review them regularly, identifying both the correct and incorrect forecasts they have made. Given the wide range of outcomes for most financial variables, an analyst will likely find that they have been wrong as much or more often than they have been right. The goal is to recognize that forecast error rates are high, so mitigating actions that widen the confidence interval of forecasts should be taken. One such action is scenario analysis. By asking, "Where could I be wrong and by how much?", an analyst can generate different forecast scenarios.
