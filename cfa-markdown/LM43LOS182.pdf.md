$D O L=1.96$
A is incorrect, as it inverts the equation; it is the ratio of the change in sales to the change in operating income.
B is incorrect; it is the ratio of the percentage change in pre-tax income, rather than operating income, to the percentage change in sales.
7. If a company reported trailing 12 months' operating cash flow of USD150 million, current assets excluding cash of USD40 million, and current liabilities of USD60 million, the company most likely:
A. was inefficient in managing its financing.
B. used trade credit to manage working capital.
C. over-extended itself and is at risk of bankruptcy.

Solution:
B is correct. Negative net working capital typically indicates that the company uses suppliers' trade credit to lengthen days payable, while also efficiently managing inventory days and days sales outstanding.
A is incorrect. Negative working capital is a source rather than a use of financing and gives an issuer more financial flexibility, as capital is not tied up in working capital.
C is incorrect. There is not enough information here to determine bankruptcy risk, but positive operating cash flows and negative net working capital are not bankruptcy risk indicators.
8. A company's management may choose not to use financial leverage because the company has:
A. an investment-grade credit rating.
B. a high degree of operating leverage.
C. a lower net debt to EBITDA ratio than its peers.

Solution:
B is correct. The degree of financial leverage and the degree of operating leverage together equal the degree of total leverage in the business. If the company already has a high degree of operating leverage, using financial leverage may increase total leverage and risk to too high a level.
A is incorrect. An investment-grade credit rating generally indicates that the company could borrow economically, which would be a reason to use financial leverage.
C is incorrect. A lower net debt to EBITDA ratio than its peers is an indicator of borrowing capacity, which would be a reason to use financial leverage.

## COMPANY RESEARCH REPORTS

describe the elements that should be covered in a thorough company research report

Analysts value and make investment recommendations on issuers' equity securities using scenarios of future earnings, cash flows, and financial position. These future scenarios are structured in the form of financial statements and are known as financial statement models. While a financial statement model is quantitative, it is not a mathematics problem to solve with a correct answer, but rather a quantitative expression of an analyst's forward-looking views. These views should be based on supporting evidence and justified by analysis.

The process of forming and justifying a view of an issuer's future financial results and position involves company and industry analysis and is the subject of this module and the next two. Exhibit 1 introduces a framework for company and industry analysis. This module focuses on the foundational block Company Analysis: Past and Present.

Exhibit 1: Company and Industry Analysis Framework

Analysts present their company and industry analysis, as well as their valuation and investment recommendation, in a company research report. The structure, content, and tone of the report depend on the analyst's setting. Reports on a public issuer's equity securities for distribution to external clients (a "sell-side report"), for example, often consist of an extensive initial report (an "initiating coverage" report, or "initiation") when the analyst begins covering the security, followed by shorter reports on specific topics or that make updates to a recommendation after the analyst receives new information or conducts additional analyses, particularly after the issuer reports financial results. Analysts' reports solely for internal distribution to an audience already familiar with the issuer might be far shorter and delivered verbally or in a handful of presentation slides.

An example of the structure of an initial company research report for external distribution is shown in Exhibit 2. The primary audience is those who are not already knowledgeable about the issuer or security.

## Exhibit 2: Initial Company Research Report Elements

| Front Matter | - Issuer name and security identifiers (e.g., symbol, CUSIP) <br> - Analysts' recommendation (buy, hold, sell) and target buy or sell prices <br> - Disclosures, disclaimers, and other legally required information |
| :--- | :--- |
| Recommendation | - Analysts' recommendation <br> - Summary of key reasons supporting the recommendation |
| Company Description | - Discussion of issuer's business model and strategy <br> - Explanatory charts and figures-for example, disaggregation of revenues and profits by product, geography, etc. |
| Industry Overview \& Competitive Positioning | - Industry size, growth rate and key drivers, market share trends, profitability-historical and outlook <br> - Competitive analysis such as Porter's Five Forces <br> - Analysis of external industry influences such as political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental ("PESTLE" analysis) <br> - Evaluation of company's position and strategy in the industry |
| Financial Analysis and Model | - Evaluation of key drivers of revenue, costs, profitability, cash flows, and the issuer's uses and sources of capital <br> - Forecasts of key drivers and supporting discussion <br> - Historical and forecasted financial statements |
| Valuation | - Estimates of company and security values with target price <br> - Typically includes relative and present value approaches <br> - Discussion of key inputs and scenario and sensitivity analyses |
| Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Considerations | - Evaluation of ESG indicators and risks <br> - Ownership structure and management composition <br> - Executive compensation |
| Risks | - Evaluation of material downside and upside risks and discussion of how they are considered in the financial analysis and valuation |

## THE CFA INSTITUTE RESEARCH CHALLENGE

For examples of initial company research reports, we encourage you to visit the Past Research Challenge Champions section of cfainstitute.org, which has winning reports and presentations from the research competition that CFA Institute and CFA Societies around the world host each year. Teams of university students are assigned a public company to research by a local CFA Society and compete on the quality of their research and modeling, valuation, and communication skills.

Subsequent company research reports are often shorter than initial reports. Their primary audience is those who are already familiar with the issuer or security and require an update based on new information and analyses or a change in the analyst's recommendation. Such a report for a company that recently reported quarterly financial results may be structured in the form shown in Exhibit 3. The structure of a subsequent report depends on the analyst's setting and the nature of the report.

## Exhibit 3: Subsequent Company Research Report Elements

| Front Matter | - Analysts' names <br> - Issuer name <br> - Security and exchange identifiers (e.g., symbol, CUSIP) <br> - Analysts' recommendation: buy, hold, sell <br> - Current security price and analysts' target price <br> - Disclosures, disclaimers, and other legally required information <br> - Analysts' recommendation <br> - Summary of changes to the recommendation and support explanations |
| :--- | :--- |
| Analysis of New Information | - Comparison of quarterly actual results with expected results <br> - Analysts' interpretation of new information and changes to forecasts <br> - Historical and updated forecasted financial statements |
| Valuation | - Estimates of company and security values <br> - Discussion of changes from valuation in prior report |
| Risks | - Update of risk factors from prior report with discussion of changes |

## QUESTION SET

1. Which of the following statements about initiation reports is true?
A. The structure, content, and tone of the report are independent of the analyst's setting.
B. The report makes updates to the recommendation after the issuer reports financial results.
C. The primary audience is those who are not already knowledgeable about the issuer or security.

## Solution:

C is correct. The primary audience is those who are not already knowledgeable about the issuer or security.
A is incorrect, because the structure, content, and tone of the report are dependent on the analyst's setting. Examples include whether the report is meant for internal or external distribution and whether it is an in-depth initiation report or a subsequent report updating the reader after a change in recommendation or the release of the issuer's quarterly results.
B is incorrect, because the initial report is to help those who are not already knowledgeable to understand the issuer or security. A subsequent research report is used to update the audience after the release of financial results.
2. If you read a research report that includes both a Porter's Five Forces analysis and a PESTLE analysis, then most likely:
A. the authoring analyst is initiating coverage.
B. the report is updating a recommendation after an earnings release.
C. the report is written by a firm's analyst who has covered the company for many years.

## Solution:

A is correct. A Porter's Five Forces analysis and a PESTLE analysis are common elements in initiations and are less common in subsequent research reports, as they tend to evolve more slowly than other report elements such as financial analyses and models.
B and C are incorrect; these elements are common in subsequent rather than initial research reports.
3. The evaluation of a company's competitive strategy takes place before the:
A. analysis of revenue and revenue drivers.
B. analysis of operating profitability and working capital.
C. forecasting of revenue, operating profitability, and working capital.

## Solution:

C is correct. Forecasting takes place only after company analysis and industry and competitive analysis are complete. The evaluation of a company's competitive strategy is part of the industry and competitive analysis. A is incorrect, because the analysis of revenue and revenue drivers is part of the first stage of analysis, where the analyst studies the company's past and present financial statements. As we shall see in Lesson 3, analysts start by analyzing the revenue line items first.
B is incorrect, because the analysis of operating profitability and working capital typically takes place before the industry and competitive analysis. The evaluation of the company's competitive strategy is usually part of the industry and company analysis, which takes place after completion of the analysis of operating profitability and working capital.

## DETERMINING THE BUSINESS MODEL

determine a company's business model
Determining the business model is the first step in our industry and company analysis framework because it summarizes important drivers of an issuer's financial results and position, focuses the analyst on what requires further investigation, and should begin setting the analyst's expectations for the issuer. A discussion of the business model is usually in the first part of a company research report (see the "Company Description" section in Exhibit 2).

Recall that a business model describes a company's operations and includes the following elements, which analysts investigate by answering several key questions discussed in prior learning modules.

| Business Model Element | Key Questions for Analysts |
| :--- | :--- |
| The product(s) or service(s) the company <br> sells | What is the firm selling? |
| Customers and key customer groups | To whom does the company sell? |
