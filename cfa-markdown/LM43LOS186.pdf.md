evaluate a company's capital investments and capital structure

## Sources and Uses of Capital

Firms invest capital from debt and equity investors to earn returns above their investors' required rates of return. An important consideration in company analysis is to evaluate whether required rates of return have been met or exceeded (i.e., whether economic value is created for investors) over the longer run and to assess risks and opportunities associated with the capital structure, such as the use of financial leverage. Before evaluation, a first step is to determine a company's sources and uses of capital on a historical basis, as shown generically in Exhibit 6.

Exhibit 6: Sources and Uses of Capital

| Sources of Capital | Uses of Capital |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cash flows from operations, including net working capital (if negative) | Cash and investments on hand |
| Debt issuance | Net working capital (if positive) |
| Equity issuance | Capital expenditures and additions to intangibles |
| Asset disposals | Acquisitions |
|  | Debt paydown |
|  | Dividends and share repurchases |

## Evaluating Capital Investments and Capital Structure

Returns on invested capital over the longer run, compared with investors' required rates of return, can be used to evaluate whether management has used investors' capital wisely. Recall that independent investment analysts do not have access to the same information that management uses to assess individual projects with IRRs and NPVs, so analysts have to use more aggregated measures to discern whether there have been worsening or improving trends in value creation.

Risks related to the capital structure can be measured using leverage and coverage ratios, credit ratings by third-party rating agencies, and the sensitivity of net income to changes in operating income known as the degree of financial leverage, as shown in Equation 3. The degree of financial leverage is increased by higher interest expenses that are fixed with respect to operating income. The degree of financial leverage is analogous to the degree of operating leverage but is determined by financing costs rather than fixed operating costs.

## Evaluating Warehouse Club Inc.'s Capital Investments and Capital Structure

Elaine Nguyen calculates the following information on Warehouse over 2X10-2X19. Additionally, the company's interest coverage ratio (EBIT to interest expense) has been over 20 times and recently reached 30 times in 2X19, and the company's credit is rated investment grade by major credit rating agencies.

Nguyen makes the following observations:

- The company has created value for investors, with a spread of ROIC over WACC of 200-700 basis points since 2X10. WACC has declined slightly over time as interest rates have fallen; this calculation assumes a constant required rate of return on equity of $9 \%$.
- The company's returns on capital are far higher than its low operating and net margins would suggest, owing to its high asset turnover and negative net working capital as a low-cost means of financing from suppliers, requiring less capital from investors.
- The company has a conservative capital structure, with negative net debt and a degree of financial leverage close to 1.0 because interest expense is largely covered by interest income on cash holdings (i.e., net and operating income move together).
- The capital structure conservatism is evidenced in the counterfactual ROIC, which excludes cash and investments on the balance sheet. While an exaggeration (the company would need some cash on hand), ROIC could be almost 15 percentage points higher if the company reduced net cash by investing in value-creating projects or by returning capital.

Unlevered returns, as measured by ROIC or return on assets, are augmented by financial leverage to produce levered returns, or return on equity, which was introduced in an earlier module. We can use return on equity and its decomposition as a comprehensive measure of profitability for an issuer. The ROE decomposition for Warehouse Club Inc. illustrates the drivers of the company's levered returns, which are well in excess of its net margin.

## QUESTION SET

Questions 1-4 relate to Iliso's financial statements in the lesson "Determining the Business Model".

1. In 2X19, the market value of Iliso's equity was $\$ 1,178$ million, and the book value of debt, which was approximately equal to the market value, was $\$ 144$ million. Assuming a cost of debt of $5.5 \%$, cost of equity of $12 \%$, tax rate of $24 \%$, and price-to-book ratio of 1.0, Iliso's WACC is closest to:
A. $11.15 \%$.
B. $11.30 \%$.
C. $12.00 \%$.

## Solution:

A is correct. Recall that:

WACC $=$ [weighting of debt $\times$ gross cost of debt $\times(1-$ tax rate $)]+($ weighting of equity $\times$ cost of equity).

Total capital is $\$ 1,178+\$ 144=\$ 1,322$ million. Weighting of debt is therefore $\$ 144 / \$ 1,322=10.89 \%$, and Weighting of equity is $1-$ Weight of debt $=$ $89.11 \%$.
Therefore, WACC $=[10.89 \% \times 5.5 \% \times(1-24 \%)]+(89.11 \% \times 12 \%)=11.15 \%$.
B is incorrect, because it incorrectly calculates WACC using a pre-tax rather than after-tax cost of debt.
C is incorrect; it is the cost of equity.
2. Why might Iliso's WACC be significantly higher than Warehouse Club's WACC, as calculated earlier in the module?
A. Warehouse Club's business model is less risky than e-commerce.
B. Warehouse Club's capital structure, with degree of financial leverage close to 1.0, is less conservative than Iliso's.
C. Iliso is an established retailer with an investment-grade rating.

Solution:
A is correct. The cost of equity is the compensation that equity investors demand for the business and financial risks of investing in an issuer's equity securities. Iliso's cost of equity is $12 \%$, whereas Warehouse Club's is $9 \%$, reflecting Warehouse Club's longer operating history, more proven business model, and competitive positioning.
B is incorrect, because Warehouse Club's capital structure, with degree of financial leverage of 1.0, would imply almost $100 \%$ weighting of equity, whereas Iliso has an $11 \%$ debt weighting and therefore Warehouse's capital structure is more conservative.
C is incorrect, because an investment-grade rating would reduce Iliso's cost of debt and WACC.
3. Iliso's degree of financial leverage in 2 X 19 is closest to:
A. 0.77.
B. 1.13.
C. 1.84.

Solution:
B is correct, calculated as Change in net income/Change in operating income $=(100 / 52-1)$ divided by $(130 / 72-1)=1.146$.
A is incorrect, because it is incorrectly calculated as 2X19 Net income/Operating income $=100 / 130=0.77$.
C is incorrect, because it is Iliso's equity multiplier: Total assets/Equity = $2,168 /(592+586)=1.84$.
4. Explain why Iliso's ROE differs from Warehouse Club's ROE.

## Solution:

Iliso's ROE is lower than Warehouse Club's ROE.
ROE $=$ Net margin $\times$ Asset turnover $\times$ Equity multiplier
$\mathrm{ROE}=1.3 \% \times 3.5 \times 1.84$
$=8.37 \%$, which is less than half of Warehouse Club's $18 \%$ ROE.
This primarily results from Iliso's lower net margin ( $1 \%$ versus $2 \%$ ) and an equity multiplier that is $40 \%$ lower ( 1.84 versus 3 ), which is somewhat offset by Iliso's higher asset turnover ( 3.5 versus 3 ).
