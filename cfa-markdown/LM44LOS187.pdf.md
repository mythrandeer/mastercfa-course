7. Impression Ltd. is a fictional company that designs, manufactures, and sells skin care and beauty products. A PESTLE analysis for Impression Ltd. would most likely identify which of the following?
A. A customer of Impression Ltd., a large e-commerce retailer, is acquiring a private-label manufacturer of skin care products.
B. Increased discussion by legislatures around instituting an excise tax on disposable plastic packaging as part of a package of carbon taxes
C. An online, direct sales competitor has launched a suite of photo filters that integrate with leading social media apps based on its beauty products.

## Solution:

B is correct. PESTLE analysis is concerned with identifying and evaluating external forces on an industry, which include political forces such as a packaging tax. A and C are incorrect, as they are competitor moves within the beauty industry.
8. As a venture capital investor, you are on the board of Ridge Inc., a fictional company that is entering the auto industry, which is characterized by high capital intensity, minimal switching costs for customers because regulations require standardization of many features, and price consciousness of customers except among a relatively small percentage of affluent consumers.

Based on these observations, recommend and justify a competitive strategy to the rest of Ridge Inc.'s board.

## Solution:

A cost leadership strategy is one competitive strategy that might be successful for Ridge Inc. Since most customers are price conscious and face minimal switching costs between automakers or models, a low selling price can be an effective way to gain market share. Combined with high capital intensity, such a strategy might enable Ridge to operate at an economic profit if it produces and sells enough volume and maintains fixed-cost discipline to keep unit costs low. Other competitive strategies that might be successful for Ridge include a differentiation strategy aimed at luxury or performance customers.

## USES OF INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

describe the purposes of, and steps involved in, industry and competitive analysis

The next step in our company and industry analysis framework (Exhibit 1), introduced in the last module, is industry and competitive analysis, which involves the study of the drivers of an industry's size, profitability, and market shares and the evaluation of a company's competitive positioning in its industry.

## Why Analyze an Industry?

Many industry participants have similar business models. They often compete in the same or similar product markets as sellers and in factor markets as buyers, so they tend to be exposed to the same demand and supply opportunities and risk factors. As will be discussed later with Porter's Five Forces model, these industry structural factors result in profitability differences by industry in the long run, with company-specific factors like business model variation, competitive strategy, size, and execution creating variance around the industry median.

McGahan and Porter (1997) estimated the relative importance of industry versus company-specific effects on both the emergence of economic profits (ROIC in excess of WACC) and their sustainability over time, finding that industry was the most important factor in the sustainability of economic profits. Importantly, they found that company-specific effects were much larger for low performers than for high performers in an industry, suggesting that industry and competitive forces can act as a ceiling on a company's returns but not as a floor.

A useful way to think about this dynamic is that competition "pulls" company profitability to an industry base rate over time. Industry and competitive analysis is used to estimate that base rate and its determinants, to form a forward-looking perspective on potential structural changes, and, finally, to analyze firms' relative strengths and weaknesses to determine their position against the base rate. It is important to emphasize, though, that these measures and outcomes are dynamic and that some companies have outperformed or underperformed their industry in economic profitability for many years.

## Improve Forecasts

Competitive forces from industry incumbents, substitutes, suppliers, and customers discipline companies' prices and costs, market share, and thus profitability. By taking an industry perspective and better understanding these drivers-as well as building a database of past competitive actions and strategies by firms in an industry and their track records of success-analysts can sharpen their forecasts and alertness to what is most important. Guan, Wong, and Zhang (2014) found that sell-side investment analysts who covered both companies and their suppliers made more accurate earnings
forecasts than those who did not cover the suppliers. Without a broader perspective, an analyst may underrate competitive forces and overate the degree to which a company controls its destiny.

## Identify Investment Opportunities

Industry analysis may uncover an attractive investment candidate that an analyst was previously unaware of or had not fully appreciated until assessing its strengths and weaknesses relative to industry peers and competitors. In addition, some investors may conclude that it is the industry, not any specific company, that they want exposure to, and in fact would like to diversify away the company-specific risks. These investors might take a basket approach by investing in several companies with position sizes scaled by size, liquidity, or relative attractiveness.

## Industry and Competitive Analysis Steps

We approach industry and competitive analysis through the process shown in Exhibit 2 , which begins with defining an industry and ends with evaluating a company's competitive positioning in the context of that industry.

## QUESTION SET

1. Over the long run:
A. business cycles result in profitability differences by industry.
B. company-specific factors such as competitive strategy result in profitability differences by industry.
C. structural factors result in profitability differences by industry.

## Solution:

C is correct. Structural factors, such as Porter's Five Forces, drive profitability and profitability differences by industry in the long run. Company-specific factors result in company profitability levels around the industry median, while changes in the business cycle drive short-run profitability for both industries and companies.
2. Which of the following is an industry, not a company-specific, attribute?
A. Competitive strategy
B. Business model variation
C. Sensitivity to the business cycle

## Solution:

C is correct. Sensitivity to the business cycle is an example of a factor that influences an entire industry.
$A$ and $B$ are examples of company-specific attributes, which also include company size and strategy execution.
3. Explain why industry has a significant effect on company growth and profitability.

## Solution:

Companies in the same industry compete in similar product markets as sellers and in factor markets as buyers, so they tend to be exposed to the same demand and supply opportunities and risk factors. For example, while a restaurant company that sells chicken has a different product than a restaurant that sells pastries, both are competing for a similar customer need (prepared food), employ similarly skilled workers, and have capital equipment and real estate.

## INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION

describe industry classification methods and compare methods by which companies can be grouped

An industry is commonly defined as companies that sell similar products or services, from the perspective of a customer. Challenges in defining an industry include whether to include substitutes, classifying companies that operate in multiple industries, geographical considerations, and making updates since business models are always evolving. To help analysts contend with these difficulties, third-party organizations maintain industry classification schemes that are widely used in investment management.
