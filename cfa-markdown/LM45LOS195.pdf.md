| mation should probably not be used directly to develop detailed forecasts by category, because those forecasts would not be verifiable and would not be an efficient use of the analyst's time. |

| 2. It is most appropriate to forecast Iliso's cost of revenue as a percentage of its: <br> A. retail sales. <br> B. total revenues. <br> C. total GMV sales. <br> Solution: <br> A is correct. Cost of revenue should be based on Iliso's retail sales. Cost of revenue is unaffected by third-party merchandise sales unless the merchant uses Iliso's fulfillment network for warehousing and delivery. The company does not provide information on such use by third parties, and it would be a small cost compared with cost of revenue for Iliso's retail sales. Iliso's cost of revenue is primarily composed of the inventory costs of products sold to customers where Iliso records revenue gross. |
| 3. Discuss the use of a historical base rates and convergence approach, calculated using other retailers' financial results, for forecasting Iliso's operating expenses. <br> Solution: <br> Iliso's e-commerce business model and the breadth of the retail sales industry may make industry averages inappropriate to use for Iliso. However, if there are larger, more mature e-commerce retailers to calculate statistics for, this approach may be appropriate. |
| 4. If food and grocery increases as a proportion of Iliso's retail sales, which of the following would most likely increase? <br> A. Inventory turnover <br> B. Gross profit margin <br> C. Current assets/sales <br> Solution: <br> A is correct. Inventory turnover would increase because of the perishable nature of food and grocery. Inventory as a percentage of sales would decrease, resulting in a decrease in current assets to sales. | STRUCTURE

explain approaches to forecasting a company's capital investments and capital structure

Projections for long-term assets are based on cash flow statement and income statement projections, because net PP\&E and intangible assets on the balance sheet primarily increase due to capital expenditures and decrease due to depreciation and
amortization expenses. Capital expenditures can be broken down into maintenance capital expenditures necessary to sustain the current business and growth capital expenditures needed to expand the business. Maintenance capital expenditure forecasts are often based on historical depreciation and amortization expenses, usually with a small adjustment upward to account for inflation in capital goods. For businesses with low fixed asset turnover, maintenance capital expenditure requirements can be quite high. Growth capital expenditure forecasts are more discretionary and are tied to management's expansion plans and revenue growth. Depreciation and amortization forecasts are based on net PP\&E and intangibles on the balance sheet (which increase due to capital expenditures) and their useful lives as assumed by management's accounting policies, which can be approximated by the ratio of gross fixed assets to depreciation and amortization expenses. Information may also be found in the notes to the financial statements.

Analysts must also make projections about a company's future capital structure. Leverage ratios—such as debt to capital, debt to equity, and debt to EBITDA—are often used as the forecast object to project future debt and equity levels. Analysts should consider historical company practice, management's financial strategy, and the capital requirements implied by the capital expenditure assumptions when projecting the future capital structure. Management may provide guidance on target capital structure, debt covenant ratios (e.g., net debt to EBITDA), and capital expenditures, sometimes broken down into maintenance, growth, and acquisitions. Example 3 demonstrates the use of these forecast objects for YY Ltd., the same company in Example 2.

## EXAMPLE 3

## Balance Sheet Modeling

Exhibit 10 shows financial data for YY Ltd. related to its PP\&E and intangible assets. Based on the data in Exhibit 10 and the data and analysis in Example 2, answer Questions 1 and 2.

## Exhibit 10: YY Ltd. Long-Term Asset Data (CNY millions)

| Year | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PP\&E, net | 5,068 | 6,992 | 6,306 |
| Goodwill | 282 | 248 | 253 |
| Intangible assets, net | 1,779 | 1,424 | 4,013 |
| Total fixed assets | 7,129 | 8,664 | 10,572 |
| Capital expenditures - PP\&E | 3,785 | 3,405 | 3,026 |
| Capital expenditures - intangibles | 333 | 142 | 3,310 |
| Depreciation expense | 220 | 324 | 518 |
| Amortization expense | 529 | 486 | 666 |

Note: PP\&E and intangibles asset account balances were also affected each year by changes in exchange rates and by disposals, which are not shown in the exhibit. Assume that such effects are zero in years 4-6.

1. Calculate the following:
A. Capital expenditures (for both PP\&E and intangibles) as a percentage of revenue (for years 1-3)
B. Depreciation expense as a percentage of beginning-of-year PP\&E, net (for years 2 and 3)
C. Amortization expense as a percentage of beginning-of-year intangible assets, net (for years 2 and 3).
Solution:
Using the data, the following percentages were calculated.

| Year | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 174,915 | 205,839 | 245,866 |
| Capital expenditures - PP\&E (\% of revenue) | 2.2\% | 1.7\% | 1.2\% |
| Capital expenditures - intangibles (\% of revenue) | 0.2\% | 0.1\% | 1.3\% |
| Depreciation (\% of beginning PP\&E) |  | 6\% | 7\% |
| Amortization (\% of beginning intangibles) |  | 27\% | 47\% |

2. Given the following assumptions and forecast revenue from Example 2, calculate expected total fixed assets for years 4-6.

- Capital expenditures for PP\&E as a percentage of revenue to remain at the year 3 level
- Capital expenditures for intangibles as a percentage of revenue to remain at the year 1 level
- Goodwill to remain at the year 3 level
- Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of beginning-of-year PP\&E, net, and intangible assets, net, to remain at year 3 levels


## Solution:

Using the data provided, expected total fixed assets for years 4-6 was calculated as CNY12,351 million; CNY15,179 million; and CNY18,662 million, respectively. PP\&E, net, for each year was calculated as the prior period balance plus capital expenditures minus depreciation expense. Intangible assets, net, for each year was calculated in a similar fashion. Goodwill was held constant at CNY253 million.

| Year | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 174,915 | 205,839 | 245,866 | 290,122 | 336,541 | 380,292 |

3. Based on Exhibit 11, which shows financial data for YY Ltd. related to its capital structure and profitability, answer Question 3.

Exhibit 11: YY Ltd. Debt and Profitability Data (CNY millions)

| Year | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gross debt | 10,931 | 17,624 | 17,597 |
| Revenue | 174,915 | 205,839 | 245,866 |
| EBITDA | 9,304 | 12,343 | 14,190 |
| EBITDA margin | 5.3\% | 6.0\% | 5.8\% |

YY Ltd. management has a year 6 gross debt to EBITDA ratio target of 2.0.
A. Assuming an EBITDA margin of $6.0 \%$, revenue forecasts from Example 2, and gross debt to EBITDA ratios of 1.25, 1.50, and 2.0 for years 4, 5, and 6, respectively, calculate expected gross debt for years 4-6.
B. Given the results of part A, how much incremental borrowing does the forecast imply from year 3 to year 6?

## Solution:

Gross debt of CNY21,579 million; CNY30,289 million; and CNY45,635 million are estimated for years 4-6, respectively, for YY Ltd. This forecast is made by first multiplying forecast revenue by the forecast EBITDA margin to calculate forecast EBITDA. Then, the expected gross debt to EBITDA ratio is multiplied by the forecast EBITDA to calculate forecast gross debt.

Exhibit 12 discusses forecast objects and approaches that Elaine Nguyen can use for Warehouse Club Inc.'s capital expenditures and gross debt to EBITDA.

Exhibit 12: Forecast Approaches for Warehouse Club Inc's Capital Expenditures and Structure

| Forecast Object | Forecast Approach | Example of Object and Approach for Warehouse Club Inc. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales | Historical results | Warehouse has spent $2 \%$ of net sales on capital expenditures for the last 10 years, which Nguyen can use as the forecast going forward. |
|  | Historical base rates and convergence | More mature retailers (e.g., Walmart in the USA) have all but stopped opening new stores, which has reduced their capital requirements to maintenance and new initiatives like e-commerce. If Warehouse does not intend to go to new geographies or launch an e-commerce business, Nguyen might forecast capital expenditures trending down to maintenance level, along with a decline in new-store openings per year, as Warehouse matures. |
|  | Management guidance | Warehouse management provides guidance on new-store openings, which Nguyen can use to forecast capital expenditures (along with a maintenance capital expenditure forecast and a forecast for growth capital expenditures per new store). |
|  | Analyst's discretionary forecast | Nguyen might instead use a discretionary forecast for capital expenditures by projecting a maintenance CAPEX amount (not disclosed by management) and growth CAPEX associated with new-store openings. |
| Forecast Object | Forecast Approach | Example of Object and Approach for Warehouse Club Inc. |
| Gross debt to EBITDA | Historical results | For the last five years, Warehouse's ratio of debt to trailing twelve months EBITDA has been 1.10, which Nguyen can project going forward. The product of this ratio and projected EBITDA (from earlier forecasts of sales and operating expenses) is Warehouse's gross debt. |
|  | Historical base rates and convergence | Warehouse's more mature competitors and peers use a greater amount of debt in their capital structure, and return more capital to shareholders with buybacks and dividends. Nguyen might forecast the same for Warehouse over time, with an increasing ratio of debt to EBITDA and percentage of free cash flow returned to shareholders. |
|  | Management guidance | Warehouse's management may provide a target capital structure through a target debt to EBITDA ratio or credit rating, which Nguyen can use as the forecast. |
|  | Analyst's discretionary forecast | Nguyen might instead make a discretionary forecast linked to her free cash flow forecast, projecting a debt to EBITDA ratio and return of capital to shareholders. Depending on Fyleton Investments' strategy, Nguyen might engage with Warehouse's management to advocate for such a capital structure. |

## QUESTION SET

An analyst gathers the following information related to Iliso's capital expenditures and capital structure (USD millions):

|  | 2X15 | 2X16 | 2X17 | 2X18 | 2X19 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Iliso's retail sales | 2,589 | 3,424 | 5,100 | 6,052 | 7,336 |
| Operating income | -1 | 18 | 61 | 72 | 130 |
| Depreciation expense | 25 | 43 | 65 | 91 | 123 |
| PP\&E (net) | 198 | 294 | 435 | 590 | 768 |
| Short-term debt | 56 | 255 | 198 | 66 | 0 |
| Long-term debt | 43 | 157 | 168 | 144 | 144 |
| Equity | 548 | 732 | 858 | 1,006 | 1,178 |
| Capital expenditures | 79 | 140 | 208 | 247 | 301 |

1. Which of the following would the analyst most likely use in estimating Iliso's maintenance capital expenditures?
A. Operating income
B. Depreciation expense
C. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)
Solution:
B is correct. Depreciation expense can serve as the basis for maintenance capital expenditures, as it is management's estimate of the cost of fixed assets expensed on the income statement in a manner that tracks its use.
2. Which of the following approaches is most appropriate for forecasting Iliso's capital expenditures?
A. Historical results
B. Analyst's discretionary forecast
C. Historical base rates and convergence

Solution:
A is correct. Capital expenditures have been $4.1 \%$ of retail sales for the past four years ( $2 \mathrm{X} 16-2 \mathrm{X} 19$ ). The historical results approach-using the bot-tom-up driver retail sales-is most appropriate. An analyst's discretionary forecast is not required, because Iliso is not in a cyclical industry or undergoing a fundamental change. Iliso's unique model and the breadth of the industry make the approach using historical base rates and convergence to the industry inappropriate.
3. The analyst forecasts 2X20 total revenues of 8,411 million, operating income of $2 \%$ of total revenues, capital expenditures of $4 \%$ of total revenues, depreciation expense of $20 \%$ of opening PP\&E (net), and debt/EBITDA of 0.50 . The analyst's forecast for debt (in millions) is closest to:
A. 84 .
B. 161 .

## C. 195 .

## Solution:

B is correct.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 X 20 \text { operating income }=0.02(8,411)=168 \\
& 2 X 20 \text { depreciation expense }=0.20(768)=154 \\
& \text { EBITDA }=168+154=322 \\
& \text { Debt }=0.50(322)=161
\end{aligned}
$$

4. The analyst notes that Iliso's common stock and paid-in capital accounts increased, in total, by 75 million from 2X18 to 2X19, but only 42 million was reported as stock issuance on the statement of cash flows. Retained earnings increased by the amount of net income. Which of the following most likely explains the difference of 33 million?
A. A stock split
B. A stock dividend

## C. Stock-based compensation

## Solution:

C is correct. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense in the income statement and is reported as an addition to net income in the indirect method of reporting cash flow from operations. The issuance also increases common stock and paid-in capital. A stock split typically simply increases the number of shares outstanding and decreases any stated par value per share. A stock dividend increases common stock and paid-in capital and reduces retained earnings by the same amount.

## SCENARIO ANALYSIS

$$
\square \quad \text { describe the use of scenario analysis in forecasting }
$$

Recall from earlier lessons that industry and business risks may result in future outcomes that differ from expectations. The final step in forecasting involves incorporating the possibility of different outcomes based on key risk factors as well as judging their likelihood of occurrence. Generic risk factors that affect all companies-but to varying degrees-include changes in the business cycle, competition, inflation and deflation, and technological developments. Rather than develop single point estimate forecasts, analysts make several forecast scenarios that vary based on different outcomes with respect to key risk factors. Investors compare these scenarios with other analysts' (e.g., sell-side analysts) forecasts for a company, as well as forecasts implied by current valuations, to make investment decisions.

We demonstrate the use of scenario analysis for technological developments that threaten to cannibalize demand for an existing product in the following historical case study. Technological developments can affect demand for a product, the quantity supplied of a product, or both. When changes in technology lead to lower manufacturing
