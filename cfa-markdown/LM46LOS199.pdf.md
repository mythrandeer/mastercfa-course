2. Based on a company's EPS of $€ 1.35$, an analyst estimates the intrinsic value of a security to be $€ 16.60$. Which type of model is the analyst most likely to be using to estimate intrinsic value?
A. Multiplier model.
B. Present value model.
C. Asset-based valuation model.

## Solution to 2:

A is correct. The analyst is using a multiplier model based on the P/E multiple. The P/E multiple used was $16.60 / 1.35=12.3$.

As you begin the study of specific equity valuation models in the next section, you must bear in mind that any model of value is, by necessity, a simplification of the real world. Never forget this simple fact! You may encounter models much more complicated than the ones discussed here, but even those models will be simplifications of reality.

## BACKGROUND FOR THE DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODEL

Present value models follow a fundamental tenet of economics which states that individuals defer consumption-that is, they invest-for the future benefits expected. Individuals and companies make an investment because they expect thereby to earn a rate of return over the investment period. Logically, the value of an investment should be equal to the present value of the expected future benefits. For common shares, an analyst can equate benefits to the cash flows to be generated by the investment. The simplest present value model of equity valuation is the dividend discount model (DDM), which specifies cash flows from a common stock investment to be dividends.

The next section describes aspects of dividends that users of dividend discount models should understand.

## Dividends: Background for the Dividend Discount Model

Generally, there are two sources of return from investing in equities: (1) cash dividends received by an investor over his or her holding period and (2) the change in the market price of equities over that holding period.

A dividend is a distribution paid to shareholders based on the number of shares owned, and a cash dividend is a cash distribution made to a company's shareholders. Cash dividends are typically paid out regularly at known intervals; such dividends are known as regular cash dividends. By contrast, an extra dividend or special dividend is a dividend paid by a company that does not pay dividends on a regular schedule or a
dividend that supplements regular cash dividends with an extra payment. Companies in cyclical industries and companies undergoing corporate and/or financial restructuring are among those observed to use extra dividends. ${ }^{1}$

The payment of dividends is not a legal obligation: dividends must be declared (i.e., authorized) by a company's board of directors; in some jurisdictions, they must also be approved by shareholders. Regular cash dividends are customarily declared and paid out quarterly in the United States and Canada; semiannually in Europe and Japan; and annually in some other countries, including China.

Dividend discount models address discounting expected cash dividends. A stock dividend (also known as a bonus issue of shares) is a type of dividend in which a company distributes additional shares of its common stock (typically, $2 \%-10 \%$ of the shares then outstanding) to shareholders instead of cash. A stock dividend divides the "pie" (the market value of shareholders' equity) into smaller pieces without affecting the value of the pie or any shareholder's proportional ownership in the company. Thus, stock dividends are not relevant for valuation. Stock splits and reverse stock splits are similar to stock dividends in that they have no economic effect on the company or shareholders. A stock split involves an increase in the number of shares outstanding with a consequent decrease in share price. An example of a stock split is a two-for-one stock split in which each shareholder is issued an additional share for each share currently owned. A reverse stock split involves a reduction in the number of shares outstanding with a corresponding increase in share price. In a one-for-two reverse stock split, each shareholder would receive one new share for every two old shares held, thereby reducing the number of shares outstanding by half.

In contrast to stock dividends and stock splits, share repurchases are an alternative to cash dividend payments. A share repurchase (or buyback) is a transaction in which a company uses cash to buy back its own shares. Shares that have been repurchased are not considered for dividends, voting, or computing earnings per share. A share repurchase is viewed as equivalent to the payment of cash dividends of equal value in terms of the effect on shareholders' wealth, all other things being equal. Company managements have expressed several key reasons for engaging in share repurchasesnamely, (1) signaling a belief that their shares are undervalued (or, more generally, to support share prices), (2) flexibility in the amount and timing of distributing cash to shareholders, (3) tax efficiency in markets where tax rates on dividends exceed tax rates on capital gains, and (4) the ability to absorb increases in outstanding shares because of the exercise of employee stock options.

The payout of regular cash dividends to common shareholders follows a fairly standard chronology that is set in motion once the company's board of directors votes to pay the dividend. First is the declaration date, the day that the company issues a statement declaring a specific dividend. Next comes the ex-dividend date (or ex-date), the first date that a share trades without (i.e., "ex") the dividend. This is followed closely (one or two business days later) by the holder-of-record date (also called the owner-of-record date, shareholder-of-record date, record date, date of record, or date of book closure), the date that a shareholder listed on the company's books will be deemed to have ownership of the shares for purposes of receiving the upcoming dividend; the amount of time between the ex-date and the holder-of-record date is linked to the trade settlement cycle in force. The final milestone is the payment date (or payable date), which is the day that the company actually mails out (or electronically transfers) a dividend payment to shareholders.

## EXAMPLE 3

## Total S.A. Dividend Payment Time Line

On 26 May 2017, Total S.A., one of the world's largest integrated energy companies, declared an annual dividend of $€ 2.48$ per share, payable on a quarterly basis. The first quarterly dividend of $€ 2.48 / 4=€ 0.62$ was payable on 12 October 2017. The holder-of-record date was 26 September, and the ex-dividend date was 25 September. A timeline for the upcoming Total S.A. quarterly dividend is shown in Exhibit 1.

Because buyers of a company's shares on the ex-dividend date are no longer eligible to receive the upcoming dividend, all else being equal, on that day the company's share price immediately decreases by the amount of the foregone dividend. Exhibit 2 illustrates the decrease in share price that occurs for a hypothetical company that has declared a $\$ 1.00$ per share dividend as trading begins on its ex-dividend date.

Note: Assumes dividend declared is $\$ 1$ per share and convention for stock trade settlement is $T+3$.


[^0]:    1 Another type of dividend is a liquidating dividend, which is a return of capital rather than a distribution from earnings or retained earnings. Liquidating dividends are used when a company goes out of business and distributes its net assets, sells a portion of its business for cash and distributes the sale's proceeds, or pays a dividend that exceeds its accumulated retained earnings.
