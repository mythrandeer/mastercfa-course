B. is anything that can be stored and transmitted electronically and has associated ownership or use rights.
C. must adhere to very specific designs or requirements in order to work within the limited types of technology that support it.

## Solution:

The correct answer is B. Digital assets continue to evolve and vary in terms of design and application. Digital assets can be thought of as anything that can be stored and transmitted electronically and has associated ownership or use rights. A is incorrect because digital assets include cryptocurrencies, tokens (security and utility), and digital collectables (such as digital art). C is incorrect because digital assets may take many forms (such as digital tokens and virtual currencies) and may use various underlying technologies. They are not limited to specific designs or technology.
4. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: Alternative investment categories include $\qquad$ , $\qquad$ , and
$\qquad$ .

## Solution:

Alternative investment categories include private capital, real assets, and hedge funds.

## ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT METHODS

compare direct investment, co-investment, and fund investment methods for alternative investments

Investors seeking greater diversification and higher expected returns from alternative investments must consider how best to enter into such an investment. The long-term, illiquid nature of many alternative investments along with the specialized knowledge involved in evaluating and overseeing these investments make investors more dependent on manager decisions over longer time periods. Large, sophisticated investors can address this issue by taking greater control over the investment process, while other, less sophisticated investors must outsource this process and seek to align manager incentives with investor objectives.

## Alternative Investment Methods

Investors can access alternative investments in three ways:

- Fund investment (such as a in a PE fund)
- Co-investment into a portfolio company of a fund
- Direct investment into a company or project (such as infrastructure or real estate)

Institutional investors typically begin investing in alternative investments via funds. Then, as they gain experience, they may begin to invest via co-investing and direct investing. The largest and most sophisticated direct investors (such as some
sovereign wealth funds) compete with fund managers for access to the best investment opportunities. Exhibit 1 shows an illustration of the three methods of investing in alternative investments. We will refer to this exhibit several times during this lesson.

## Exhibit 1: Three Methods of Investing in Alternative Assets

## Fund Investment

Investors with limited resources and/or experience generally enter into alternative investments through fund investing, where the investor contributes capital to a fund and the fund identifies, selects, and makes investments on the investor's behalf. For the fund's services, the investor is charged a management fee, plus a performance fee if the fund manager delivers superior results versus a hurdle rate or benchmark. In Exhibit 1, the investor invests in the "alternative investments fund." The fund itself invests in three investments: Investments 1, 2, and 3. Fund investing can be viewed as an indirect method of investing in alternative assets.

Fund investors have little or no leeway in the sense that their investment decisions are limited to either investing in the fund or not. Fund investors typically have neither the sophistication nor the experience to invest directly on their own. Furthermore, fund investors are typically unable to affect the fund's underlying investments. Note that fund investing is available for all major alternative investment types, including hedge funds, private capital, real estate, infrastructure, and natural resources.

Allocation to alternative assets requires distinct specialized skills that many investors likely do not possess. These investors can achieve this exposure through fund investing, where one or more investors contribute capital to an investment management company that identifies, selects, manages, and monitors investments on the investors' behalf, as shown in Exhibit 2.

Fund investment structures for alternative investments differ substantially from traditional public equity and fixed-income fund or ETF investments. For example, alternative funds usually involve (1) the pre-commitment of funds prior to investment selection and an extended period during which the fund may not be sold, (2) higher management fees with more complex fee structures, and (3) less frequent transparency on periodic returns and fund positions versus equity or fixed-income funds. Investors in alternative funds therefore usually compensate managers using a performance-based, as opposed to flat, fee structure to better align manager and investor incentives over longer periods. Important terms are provided in a term sheet; a sample term sheet for fund investment with Tenderledge Investments LLC is provided in Exhibit 3. Further details of these terms are discussed in subsequent lessons.

## Co-Investment

Once investors have some experience investing in funds, prior to investing directly themselves, many investors gain direct investing experience via co-investing, where the investor invests in assets indirectly through the fund but also possesses rights (known as co-investment rights) to invest directly in the same assets. Through co-investing, an investor is able to make an investment alongside a fund when the fund identifies deals; the investor is not limited to participating in the deal solely by investing in the fund. Exhibit 1 illustrates the co-investing method: The investor invests in one deal (labeled "Investment 3") indirectly via fund investing while investing an additional amount directly via a co-investment. Co-investing allows investors to expand their investment knowledge, skills, and experience beyond what they would gain from taking a fund-only investment approach. Co-investing also provides investors access to an investment opportunity at a lower fee than they would owe as fund-only investors in the same asset. Co-investors can learn from the fund's process to eventually pursue direct investments themselves. Co-investors weigh the benefits of greater control and lower fees versus higher oversight costs.

Managers benefit from choosing one or more co-investors to

- accelerate investment timing when available funds and expected inflows are insufficient for a specific deal,
- expand the scope of available new investments, and
- increase diversification of an existing pool of fund investments.


## EXAMPLE 5

## Co-Investment Opportunity

Moreton Bay Pension Plan is an investor in Tenderledge LLC Alternatives Fund. Tenderledge has identified a take-private transaction in Fancy Roofing Co. that requires a USD1.5 billion capital investment. However, the fund concentration limit allows Tenderledge to invest only up to USD1 billion in any one investment. Tenderledge offers the additional USD0.5 billion to Moreton Bay Pension Plan and other investors in the fund as a co-investment on a reduced fee and no carry basis. In this case, the co-investment allows Tenderledge the ability to secure the investment without needing to bring an additional fund manager into the transaction, and the co-investors gain additional exposure to Fancy Roofing Company at a reduced management fee and zero performance fees.

## Direct Investment

The largest, most sophisticated investors with sufficient skills and knowledge to manage individual alternative investments often do so via direct investing without the use of an intermediary, as previously shown in Exhibit 1 (labeled "Investment A").

Direct investors retain maximum flexibility and control when it comes to investment choice, methods of financing, and timing. In the case of private equity, this involves the purchase of a direct stake in a private company without the use of a fund managed by an external asset manager or general partner. It also requires the direct investor to have the resources to provide the specialized knowledge, skills, and oversight capabilities that direct investment requires. Although the direct investment approach usually applies to private capital and real estate, some very large investors, such as pensions and sovereign wealth funds, also invest directly in infrastructure and natural resources.

## EXAMPLE 6

## Direct Investment in Renewable Energy

Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC announced in 2021 that it will directly invest USD240 million in a Singapore-based energy firm, Arctic Green Energy, becoming an equity partner in the firm. The investment will help Arctic Green Energy expand its global operations and increase its capability in geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is derived from hot underground springs and is a renewable, economically competitive, and sustainable alternative to using fossil fuels for heating and cooling. Arctic Green Energy uses geothermal resources to generate power and produce clean heat. GIC has noted that investing sustainably is one of its core long-term investment mandates.

## QUESTION SET

1. Referring to the diagram below, identify the label that best corresponds to the three methods of investing in alternative assets:

## Solution (as seen in Exhibit 1 of this lesson):

A. 2 is correct. In fund investing, the investor contributes capital to a fund and the fund identifies, selects, and makes investments on the investor's behalf.
B. 1 is correct. In co-investing, the investor invests in assets indirectly through the fund but also possesses rights (known as co-investment rights) to invest directly in the same assets.
C. 3 is correct. In direct investing, an investor makes a direct investment in an asset (labeled "Investment X" in the diagram) without the use of an intermediary.
2. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks:The $\qquad$ and
$\qquad$ nature of many alternative investments and the $\qquad$ required to evaluate and oversee these investments make investors more dependent on manager decisions over longer time periods.

## Solution:

The long-termand illiquid nature of many alternative investments and the specialized knowledge required to evaluate and oversee these investments make investors more dependent on manager decisions over longer time periods.
3. Identify two reasons investment managers offer co-investment opportunities to investors. Managers might choose to add co-investors for such reasons as:
1.
2.

## Solution:

Managers might choose to add co-investors for such reasons as:

- accelerating investment timing when available funds and expected inflows are insufficient for a specific deal.
- expanding the scope of available new investments.
- increasing diversification of an existing pool of fund investments.

4. Identify one reason an investor would elect to participate in each of the following alternative investment methods:
5. Fund investing
6. Co-investing
7. Direct investing

Solution:

| 1. Fund investing | Fund investing gives investors with limited resources or experience an entrance into alternative investing. |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2. Co-investing | Investors who have better specific skills and greater ability to allocate investments to individual assets may select a more active investment approach while retaining manager involvement. This results in lower fees for the investor than for a purely fund-based approach. Also, co-investors select and manage an investment jointly with a general fund manager, which potentially gives them greater control and higher returns than they could earn in a fund-only structure. |
| 3. Direct investing | Direct investing offers investors flexibility and control when it comes to choosing their investments, selecting their preferred methods of financing, and planning their approach. |

## ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT STRUCTURES

describe investment ownership and compensation structures commonly used in alternative investments

Beyond the direct or indirect method of investing in alternatives, the illiquidity, complexity, and long-term nature of these investments require more complex structures to bridge potential gaps between manager and investor interests. Alternative investment structures may explicitly address both the roles and responsibilities of investors and managers to address these gaps. In addition, alternative investment structures tailor the distribution of returns between these two parties to better align the incentives (or interests) between manager and investor.

For example, managers may require investors to be responsible for future capital contributions, while investors may place restrictions on manager investment selection to avoid conflicts of interest or hostile takeovers among other investment criteria. Performance-based compensation structures, which can include minimum return requirements for investors, delayed payouts, and/or the ability to reclaim incentive compensation in the event of poor fund performance, encourage managers to maximize returns in the best interest of investors.

## Alternative Investment Ownership and Compensation Structures

In this section, we discuss the ownership and compensation structures of alternative investments.

## Ownership Structures

Alternative investment vehicles often take the form of partnerships in order to maximize flexibility in the investment structure to allocate business risk and return and to distribute special responsibilities between investors and managers as required. Limited partnerships, introduced in a corporate issuer lesson, involve at least one general
