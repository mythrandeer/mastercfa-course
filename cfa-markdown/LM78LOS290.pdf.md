describe the diversification benefits that private capital can provide

Since the performance of private debt and private equity greatly depend on the specific phase of a company's life cycle, performance, and risk, comparison of public debt and equity may not be appropriate. First, investing in a start-up carries greater risk than investing in a well-established firm. Second, investing in a company in a declining or disintermediated industry is unlikely to offer positive return over longer time horizons. Moreover, performance risk of a continuous investment in public equity and debt can easily be hedged away.

The vintage year is important for comparing private equity and VC investments with other funds in the same year. Each private equity fund carries a vintage year, typically defined as the year in which the fund makes its first investment. Typically, a private equity fund operates over a 10- to 12-year period, which is often segmented into an initial investment period and a subsequent harvesting period. The investment period usually is the first five years during which the capital is sourced from the limited partners and invested in various companies. The harvesting period is the remaining years of the fund, when the fund looks to exit its existing investments and to return capital to limited partners.

Because of changing business and valuation environments, funds of a certain vintage have the advantage of starting in a low-valuation, low-risk appetite, economic recovery phase and benefit from riding the wave of an economic recovery. Other vintages may be less fortunate and invest the bulk of their capital in a high-valuation environment preceding a market crash or a period of prolonged economic contraction. That is why investors are encouraged to pursue vintage diversification by investing in multiple vintage years.

The performance realized by the fund is greatly determined by the vintage year and the phase of the business cycle in which the vintage year occurred, as Exhibit 5 shows. Funds seeded during the expanding phase of the business cycle tend to earn excess returns if they fund early-stage companies. Funds seeded during the contracting phase of the business cycle tend to earn excess returns if they fund distressed companies.

Investments in private capital vary in terms of risk and return across the corporate capital structure hierarchy. Typically, private equity, as the riskiest alternative, offers the highest returns, with private debt returns declining on a continuum down to the safest, most secured form of debt-infrastructure debt. Exhibit 6 outlines various private equity and private debt categories by their risk and return levels (mirroring the risk-return pathway for traditional equity and debt investing, note the trade-off as investors select between junior and senior debt and between equity and debt).
