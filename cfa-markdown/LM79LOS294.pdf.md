4. Which of the following is a characteristic of direct investment in infrastructure?
A. High liquidity
B. Concentration risk
C. Short-term horizon

Solution:
The correct answer is B. Direct investment in infrastructure requires a large investment and results in both concentration and liquidity risks while the assets are managed and operated. Because of these risks and the typical long-term horizon, direct infrastructure investment usually takes place with a group or consortium of strategic investors that share the financial risk and/or assume a specific role in building, operating, or managing the assets.

## INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT CHARACTERISTICS

explain the investment characteristics of infrastructure investments

The type of the underlying infrastructure investment, its stage of development, its geographic location, and the way the investment is structured define the expected risk and returns, as Exhibit 8 depicts.

In the three groupings of the infrastructure development cycle-greenfield, operational secondary-stage, and brownfield-the operational secondary-stage assets with an existing track record of generating steady, bond-like cash flows possess the lowest risk and offer the lowest return to the investors. Brownfield investments, redevelopment
of existing infrastructure, are incrementally riskier, and greenfield projects are the riskiest. Exhibit 9 shows the historical risk and return statistics for infrastructure assets compared to other real asset categories.

Additionally, the type of infrastructure investment is material in determining the risk and return. While investments in basic social services infrastructure or existing regulated industries typically involve less risk and lower expected return, demand-based infrastructure projects often build on projections of future economic growth and increased usage demands and are riskier.

In developing market economies, where infrastructure investments are needed to underpin economic, social, and societal growth and benefit from increased wealth created by the economy, risks are considerable, but the returns-over long time horizons-are considerable. Greenfield infrastructure projects in developing countries offer exceptional return opportunities over very long time horizons. Exhibit 10 shows the risk profiles of various infrastructure projects.

| High-Risk Profile | Medium-Risk Profile | Low-Risk Profile |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Greenfield projects without guarantees of demand upon completion-e.g., variable electricity prices, uncertain traffic on roads and through ports | Mostly brownfield assets (with some capital expenditure requirements) and some greenfield assets (with limited construction and demand risk) | Brownfield assets with mitigated risks-e.g., fully constructed with contracted/ regulated revenues |
| Located in OECD countries and emerging markets | Located primarily in OECD countries | Located in the most stable OECD countries |
| High weighting to capital appreciation | Mix of yield and capital appreciation | High weighting to current yield |
| Target equity returns of 14\%+ | Target equity returns of 10\%-12\% | Target equity returns of 6\%-8\% |

Most infrastructure funds gravitate toward the medium- and low-risk profiles, generating an average long-term annual return around $10 \%$. As for other alternative investments, less liquid forms of direct equity ownership investments tend to offer the highest expected return with the greatest risk, while publicly traded forms of debt offer the lowest potential returns. Assets backed by stable long-term concession arrangements provide the most stable returns.

## Infrastructure Diversification Benefits

Infrastructure investors expect the assets to primarily generate stable long-term cash flows that also adjust for economic growth and inflation and secondarily expect capital appreciation, depending on the type and timing of their investment. Because infrastructure investments typically support services that face inelastic demand and/ or benefit from high barriers to entry, generate steady cash returns, and have a longer life cycle, equity investments in infrastructure offer lower correlation with public market equities and the broader economy. Effectively, infrastructure investments provide an income stream, increase portfolio diversification by adding an asset class with typically low correlation with other public investments, provide some protection for changes in GDP growth, and offer some protection against inflation. Exhibit 11 summarizes the diversification benefits of infrastructure investments and shows the low correlation between infrastructure and other market returns. It is notable that public and private infrastructure returns exhibit low correlations.

Most institutional investors consider infrastructure investments to balance public equity holdings because infrastructure has proven to be relatively resilient to swings in the equity markets. Given the stable underlying nature of cash flows, infrastructure debt tends to experience lower default rates and higher recovery than similar fixed-income instruments, and it is less subject to fluctuation over the economic cycle.

Additionally, infrastructure may better match the longer-term liability structure of certain investors, such as pension funds, superannuation schemes, and life insurance companies. It also suits the longer-term horizon of sovereign wealth funds, which tend to make the largest allocations to this asset class-around $5 \%-6 \%$ of total assets under management, according to Preqin. Long-term correlation benefits also result from the fact that most infrastructure assets have a link to inflation through regulation, concession agreements, or other fee contracts whose rates rise to or above the rate of inflation.
