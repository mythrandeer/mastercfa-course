token, which maintains price parity with some target asset-for example, the US dollar or gold-through tokenization.
Another unique type of stablecoin is called a "smart stablecoin" or an "algorithmic stablecoin," because there is no backing of physical assets for the cryptocurrency. Rather, its value is backed by another cryptocurrency or token and is linked to the US dollar "algorithmically" instead of using actual dollar reserves.

## DIGITAL ASSET INVESTMENT FORMS

describe investment forms and vehicles used in digital asset investments

Investment in digital assets can take the form of direct investment on the blockchain or indirect investments in exchange-traded products and hedge funds. Direct ownership of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies involves the use of a cryptocurrency wallet, which stores the (public and private) digital codes required to access the asset on a computer website or mobile device application. Two different types of cryptocurrency exchanges exist.

- Centralized exchanges are the most popular type of exchange. These privately held exchanges provide trading platforms for cryptocurrencies and offer volume, liquidity, and price transparency. Although the concept of centralized exchanges is incompatible with Bitcoin's decentralized ideology, they are very popular. Trading is electronic and direct, without any intermediating broker or dealer, and is hosted on private servers, exposing the centralized exchanges and their clients to security vulnerabilities. Should the exchange's servers become compromised, the entire system may become paralyzed, halting trade, and leaking vital user information-such as cryptographic keys accessing the custodial wallets leaked. Some exchanges are regulated, and depending on jurisdiction, these exchanges may be regulated as financial exchanges or other types of financial intermediaries.
- Decentralized exchanges emulate blockchain's decentralized protocol and operate similarly to how Bitcoin operates. Decentralized exchanges lack a centralized control mechanism and operate on a distributed platform without central coordination or control. This comes with the benefit that should one of the computers on the network be attacked, the exchange remains operational since there are numerous other computers that continue to operate on the network. That is why attacking decentralized exchanges is substantially more difficult, rendering such attacks almost certain to fail. Decentralized exchanges are difficult to regulate because no single individual, organization, or group controls the system. This means that those trading on decentralized exchanges are generally free to transact without any regulatory scrutiny, allowing for potentially illegal activity.

Both centralized and decentralized exchanges may face problems with fraud and manipulation and raise investor-protection concerns because they are not subject to rigorous oversight. Unlike the exchanges for more traditional assets, such as equity securities and futures contracts, cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency trading venues
are largely unregulated, and individuals or groups may engage in fraud or market manipulation (including using social media to promote cryptocurrencies in a way that artificially increases the price of a cryptocurrency).

## EXAMPLE 4

## Pump and Dump Schemes of Cryptocurrencies

In a typical pump and dump scheme, earlier investors of an asset talk it up to encourage others to buy, pushing the price up. When the price is high enough, the scheme orchestrators quickly realize profits and dump the asset in the market, leaving unknowing investors with often steep trading losses. Given the hype around cryptocurrencies and the unregulated nature of the digital assets, pump and dump schemes are widespread.

EthereumMax (EMAX) is a digital token created on the Ethereum blockchain in May 2021, but it has no other connection to Ethereum. Touted as a "culture coin" that "bridges the gap between community-driven coins and foundational coins," it was endorsed and heavily promoted by pop celebrities and famous sports stars just a month after it came into being. The price of EMAX rose sharply, with frenzied buying likely fueled by receiving heavy social media exposure. Its ascent was rapid, but its descent was faster: After one month, it had lost almost all its value and the interest in trading in it disappeared. It was then alleged that EMAX was a classic example of the typical pump and dump scheme. Subsequent legal action against the celebrities endorsing and "pumping" EMAX with false and misleading statements alleged that this scheme allowed EMAX executives to dump their holdings of EMAX for substantial profit while leaving other investors with worthless tokens.

## EXAMPLE 5

## FTX Bankruptcy

FTX, a Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange that also owns FTX.US (available to US investors), grew rapidly after its founding in 2019.

As a centralized exchange for spot cryptocurrency and stablecoins, as well as futures, FTX became one of the largest such exchanges. It also provided custodial and transaction services. In 2021, it had 1.2 million users and generated over USD 1 billion in revenue. Like many digital currency exchanges, FTX issues an exchange token (FTT), a form of utility token used on its platform by market participants. As FTT may be borrowed or lent-and grants holders a discount on FTX trading fees-it represents some value (shown in Exhibit 7).

FTX has been funded by several successive rounds of venture capital (VC) investments, raising USD 400 million from VC firms and a major pension fund. In January 2022, FTX was valued at USD 31.6 billion.

FTX was considered to be a relatively stable and trusted alternative among digital currency exchanges. In 2022, declining cryptocurrency prices and rising interest rates created liquidity pressures for FTX and other cryptocurrency market participants.

This growing liquidity stress was compounded by reports that FTX and Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm controlled by FTX's founder, held significant collateral assets in illiquid investments, including FTX-related assets. On 2 November 2022, a Coindesk article cited close ties between FTX and Alameda Research and noted that Alameda Research held over a third of its

USD 14.6 billion balance sheet either directly in FTT or as FTT-based collateral. This revelation prompted an FTT selloff by investors and customer withdrawals, with the FTT price falling from over USD 25 to around USD 1 in just over a week, as Exhibit 7 shows. On 11 November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy.

In its bankruptcy filing, FTX listed USD 9 billion in liabilities, with liquid investments comprising just USD 900 million of total assets. The number of creditors exceeds 100,000 .

## EXAMPLE 6

## Ponzi Scheme Allegation over Forsage

A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that typically involves the distribution of high returns to existing investors not from any real investment but from funds contributed by new investors. A variant of the Ponzi scheme is the pyramid Ponzi scheme, in which each level of schemers lures new investors in by promising high returns from investment opportunities that are usually fabricated. The new funds then go in to pay back the "returns" one level up. In effect, the "returns" earned by the earlier investors at the top are paid for by the cash contribution from the different levels of new investors.

Launched in January 2020, Forsage ran a decentralized blockchain platform that purportedly enabled online businesses to transact through smart contracts based on Ethereum, Tron, and Binance networks. But in August 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) laid charges against 11 individuals, including the four founders based in Russia, Georgia, and Indonesia and certain US promoters, for investment fraud. The SEC alleged that Forsage operated a typical fraudulent crypto pyramid and Ponzi scheme that raised more than USD300 million from retail investors worldwide, helped by heavy endorsement and marketing by promoters on social media.

## Direct Digital Asset Investment Forms

Direct investments in digital assets are made on various digital exchanges where the transaction is recorded on the blockchain. Once such a transaction is entered between the parties, it becomes validated on the blockchain and a permanent record of the transaction is created. Most cryptocurrency exchanges are open and available 24/7, which allows for continuous trading.

There are several risks with direct investment in cryptocurrencies. First, there is the risk for fraud, which has increased with the popularity of cryptocurrencies. Such fraud comes in many forms and includes scam ICOs, various pump and dump schemes, market manipulation, theft, and schemes that seek to gain access to credentials needed to access cryptocurrency wallet information. Second, since cryptocurrencies are usually held in a wallet that is accessible only using a unique passkey, losing access to the passkey makes the holdings in the wallet irretrievable. Around $20 \%$ of all Bitcoins are reportedly in lost or deserted wallets that their owners cannot access.

Moreover, many of the smaller cryptocurrencies may be held primarily by a small number of holders, sometimes referred to as "whales." "Whales" is jargon used by the cryptocurrency community to mean individuals or entities that hold an amount of a cryptocurrency large enough to have the ability to manipulate the price.

## EXAMPLE 7

## Cryptocurrency Whales

It was reported in mid-2022 that big investors on the Ethereum blockchain were accumulating the newly created meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB), a close competitor to Dogecoin. According to Whalestats, the crypto whale-watching platform, by August 2022, 41\% of SHIB were "burned" (sent to "dead wallets" and effectively taken out of circulation). However, the next top 10 SHIB holders were estimated to be holding around $21 \%-23 \%$ of the total tokens (or $36 \%-39 \%$ of total coins in circulation). This might have allowed those "whales" to easily influence the price of SHIB. A glimpse into the trading volume might offer a hint about the effect on price action in a thin trading market environment, when the average daily trading volume was less than $10 \%$ of the total SHIB tokens. Exhibit 8 shows data on SHIB's price and trading volume.

## Indirect Digital Asset Investment Forms

Several alternatives exist to gain indirect exposure to digital assets, including the following:

- Cryptocurrency coin trusts allow investors to trade shares in trusts holding large pools of a cryptocurrency and that trade over the counter (OTC) and behave like closed-end funds. For an investor in a coin trust, there is no need to create a digital wallet and use encryption keys to invest in cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the trusts may provide additional transparency into trading. The trusts charge substantial fees and expenses, in some cases in excess of 2\%, and may trade at a premium or discount to their net asset values.
- Cryptocurrency futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specific quantity of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency at a specified price on a particular future date. For instance, trading in Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, which tracks the price of spot Bitcoin trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. Unlike physical commodities, these contracts are typically cash settled, with no actual cryptocurrency changing hands. Trading in futures is inherently leveraged. The market for cryptocurrency futures may be less developed and potentially less liquid and more volatile than more established futures markets.
- Cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds: An increasing number of exchange-traded products, such as ETFs, seek to replicate digital asset investment returns. These ETFs typically do not directly invest in cryptocurrencies and gain exposure to the value of cryptocurrencies using cash and cryptocurrency derivatives.

## Digital Forms of Investment for Non-Digital Assets

These represent similar digital forms of investment with an underlying non-digital asset from which the investment derives its value.

A recent development is asset-backed tokens, digital claims on physical assets, financial assets, or financial instruments that are collateralized by the underlying asset and derive their value directly from the underlying asset. Asset-backed tokens are a digital representation of the ownership. Tokenized assets include gold, crude oil, real estate, and equities.

Asset-backed tokens could increase liquidity by allowing for fractional ownership of high-priced assets, such as houses, art, precious metals, and precious stones, which allows multiple investors to possess a fractional interest of the same asset. The digital representation of the ownership allows for an immutable record of ownership information and ownership transfer, which increases the transparency of these transactions and reduces transaction, intermediation, and record-keeping costs.

Financial regulators typically classify asset-backed tokens as securities, as the ownership of the token entitles the holder to an ownership interest in the underlying asset.

Asset-backed tokens are often issued on the Ethereum network or other smart contract platforms that allow for peer-to-peer interaction using interoperable, transparent smart contracts that persist for the duration of the chain. These decentralized applications, or dApps, allow for transactions to take place-and to be recorded on the blockchain-without a central coordinating mechanism.

The push for financial decentralized applications grew into a movement known as decentralized finance, or DeFi. DeFi seeks to design, combine, and develop various open-source financial applications as building blocks for sophisticated financial products and services. Effectively, DeFi is a marketplace of dApps that are designed to perform various core financial functions, including potentially acting as a medium of exchange, storage of value, tokenization of underlying assets, and immutable record keeping of ownership and transfer of ownership. Effectively, all kinds of smart contracts can be embedded in dApps to handle nearly all aspects of the traditional financial system, such as lending, trading, investment, settlement, payment, and transfer in a decentralized, authenticated and instantaneous manner. Some advocates of DeFi argue that the modern blockchain ecosystem may have more technical advantages over the traditional finance system-for example, time saving and risk reduction in settlement and asset transfer. However, the nascent idea of DeFi is yet to be fully developed. To date, most dApps have centered around extending leverage to investment and speculation in digital assets.

## QUESTION SET

1. Compare and contrast centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Solution:

- Centralized exchanges are privately held. They provide trading platforms for cryptocurrencies and offer volume, liquidity, and price transparency. Trading is electronic and direct, without any intermediating broker or dealer, and is hosted on private servers, exposing the centralized exchanges and their clients to security vulnerabilities. Should the exchange's servers be attacked, the entire system may be compromised, halting trade, and leaking vital user information. Depending on jurisdiction, some centralized exchanges are regulated as financial exchanges or other types of financial intermediaries.

3. Which of the following is not a risk in direct investment in digital assets?
A. Market manipulation
B. Pump and dump schemes
C. Failure to validate asset transfers

## Solution:

The correct answer is C. There are several risks with direct investment in cryptocurrencies, including the risk for fraud, such as scam ICOs, pump and dump schemes, market manipulation, theft, and schemes that seek to gain access to credentials needed to access cryptocurrency wallet information. However, transactions in digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and tokens are verified and authenticated by cryptographical algorithms and consensus protocols. Once a transaction is entered between the parties, it becomes validated on the blockchain and creates a permanent record of the transaction. Therefore, the DLT technology makes it very unlikely to fail validating asset transfers.
4. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: DeFi is loosely defined as a marketplace for $\qquad$ that allows for financial transactions to take place and to be recorded on the $\qquad$ without a central coordinating mechanism. DeFi seeks to design, combine, and develop various $\qquad$ as building blocks for sophisticated financial products and services.

## DIGITAL ASSET INVESTMENT RISK, RETURN, AND DIVERSIFICATION

analyze sources of risk, return, and diversification among digital asset investments

Value appreciation of digital assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been rapid since inception, most recently fueled by the introduction of more traditional indirect forms of investment. Because cryptocurrencies are a relatively new innovation, their market is subject to rapid price swings, changes, and uncertainty, with most investors considering them alternative investments.
