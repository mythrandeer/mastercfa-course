3. Which of the following is not a risk in direct investment in digital assets?
A. Market manipulation
B. Pump and dump schemes
C. Failure to validate asset transfers

## Solution:

The correct answer is C. There are several risks with direct investment in cryptocurrencies, including the risk for fraud, such as scam ICOs, pump and dump schemes, market manipulation, theft, and schemes that seek to gain access to credentials needed to access cryptocurrency wallet information. However, transactions in digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and tokens are verified and authenticated by cryptographical algorithms and consensus protocols. Once a transaction is entered between the parties, it becomes validated on the blockchain and creates a permanent record of the transaction. Therefore, the DLT technology makes it very unlikely to fail validating asset transfers.
4. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: DeFi is loosely defined as a marketplace for $\qquad$ that allows for financial transactions to take place and to be recorded on the $\qquad$ without a central coordinating mechanism. DeFi seeks to design, combine, and develop various $\qquad$ as building blocks for sophisticated financial products and services.

## Solution:

DeFi is loosely defined as a marketplace for dApps (or decentralized applications) that allow for financial transactions to take place and to be recorded on the blockchain without a central coordinating mechanism. DeFi seeks to design, combine, and develop various open-source financial applications as building blocks for sophisticated financial products and services.

## DIGITAL ASSET INVESTMENT RISK, RETURN, AND DIVERSIFICATION

analyze sources of risk, return, and diversification among digital asset investments

Value appreciation of digital assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been rapid since inception, most recently fueled by the introduction of more traditional indirect forms of investment. Because cryptocurrencies are a relatively new innovation, their market is subject to rapid price swings, changes, and uncertainty, with most investors considering them alternative investments.

## Digital Asset Investment Risks and Returns

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency values are based solely on asset appreciation, with no underlying cash flows. The market demand for the limited supply of cryptocurrencies is a significant driver of prices. For instance, the supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million Bitcoins, by design. For this reason, Bitcoins are sometimes viewed by some investors as the digital version of gold.

Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin's performance has been characterized by high return, high volatility, and low correlations with traditional asset classes, as seen in Exhibit 9 and Exhibit 10.

Exhibit 9: Monthly Log-Returns for Bitcoin and Asset Class Benchmarks between January 2011 and January 2022

|  | Bitcoin in USD | S\&P 500 Index Total Return | MSCI World Index Return | Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Average | 8.84\% | 1.13\% | 0.66\% | 0.16\% |
| Standard deviation | 0.32 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.01 |
| Coefficient of variation | 3.66 | 3.43 | 6.09 | 8.16 |

Notes: Bitcoin price in US dollars, S\&P 500 Total Return, MSCI World Index, and Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index are log-returns for January 2011 to December 2022. All series are in US dollars.

From mid-2010, when publicly available market prices were available, Bitcoin price has risen from USD0.05 at inception to the historical peak of USD68,789 on 10 November 2021, before a subsequent crash took it down to around USD17,709 on 18 June 2022. Early investors in Bitcoins were hugely rewarded with phenomenal price appreciation.

Investing in cryptocurrencies therefore comes with material risks unique to digital assets. Cryptocurrencies have a relatively brief track record, yet their volatility has remained high, as Exhibit 10 shows. Although the volatility of Bitcoin has declined, it is still much higher than the volatility of traditional financial assets, such as the S\&P 500 Index.

Bitcoin-like price and return patterns are often observed in other cryptocurrencies and may reflect a great deal of uncertainty about cryptocurrencies as an investable asset class. Given that regulation of cryptocurrencies is evolving, there still is no clear legal protection for using them as a medium of exchange. While they are regulated as a digital commodity in the United States and comprehensive rules in the EU remain pending, there is a great deal of uncertainty from an investor perspective about the quality of legal protection an investor can enjoy when investing in these assets. Considering that fraud and criminal activities are rampant among buyers, sellers, issuers, and marketers of digital assets, the continued legal and regulatory uncertainty is non-trivial. Multiple countries have placed extensive restrictions on trading and owning cryptocurrencies, such as China, which banned the asset in 2021.

## Diversification Benefits of Digital Asset Investments

Although purely speculative in nature, considered by some to have value drivers distinct from common equity and debt markets, cryptocurrencies have exhibited low correlations with traditional asset class returns. This may provide a hint that the long-term determinants of cryptocurrency prices differ from those of traditional investment assets. In practice, prices (or returns) of cryptocurrencies are driven more by market adoption, network effects, technological advancement, regulatory development, speculation, and general market risk appetite. Some of these factors are unique to this asset class. Exhibit 11 shows the monthly correlation of Bitcoin with some benchmarks.

Exhibit 11: Correlations between Monthly Log-Returns for Cryptocurrencies and Selected Asset Classes (January 2011 to January 2022)

|  | Bitcoin in US Dollars | S\&P 500 Index Total Return | MSCI World Index Return | Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bitcoin in US dollars | 1 |  |  |  |
| S\&P 500 Index |  |  |  |  |
| Total Return | 0.21 | 1 |  |  |
| MSCI World Index |  |  |  |  |
| Return | 0.22 | 0.97 | 1 |  |
| Bloomberg Global |  |  |  |  |
| Aggregate Index | 0.14 | 0.25 | 0.33 | 1 |

In this way, cryptocurrencies are potential portfolio diversifiers. The correlation of cryptocurrencies with traditional assets appears to increase, and the correlation and diversification benefits of cryptocurrencies remain to be seen.
